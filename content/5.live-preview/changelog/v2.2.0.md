**🐞 Bug Fixes**

- **Site-level field preview**: Unsaved content from site-level fields is now correctly rendered in the preview. Previously, when editing site fields (in `site.yml`), changes were not reflected in the preview until saved. Now, site-level content updates in real-time just like page-level content.
