**🐞 Bug Fixes**

- **Device preview scaling**: Device previews are no longer scaled up when smaller than the preview section container. Previously, mobile device previews (390px) could be upscaled when the preview section was wider, resulting in blurry rendering. Device previews now maintain their native resolution.
