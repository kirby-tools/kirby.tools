**🚀 Features**

- **Kirby Table plugin support**: Added translation support for the [Kirby Table plugin](https://github.com/bogdancondorachi/kirby-table-field) by Bogdan Condorachi. Table cell content is now properly translated in both Panel (client-side) and programmatic (server-side) translation modes.

**🐞 Bug Fixes**

- **File metadata batch translation**: Batch translation of file metadata is now working correctly again. Previously, file metadata (like title, alt text) was skipped during batch operations.
