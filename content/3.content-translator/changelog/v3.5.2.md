**🐞 Bug Fixes**

- **KirbyTags in single-language mode**: KirbyTags are now correctly preserved during single-language translations. Previously, KirbyTags like `(link: ... text: ...)` could be incorrectly modified when translating content for a single target language. This fix ensures tag structure remains intact while only translating the relevant text attributes. See [KirbyTags configuration](/docs/content-translator/advanced/kirbytags) for details.
