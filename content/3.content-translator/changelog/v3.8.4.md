**🐞 Bug Fixes**

- **Batch translation restored for view buttons**: Batch translations from Panel view buttons are now enabled by default again. A regression in v3.8.3 accidentally disabled this functionality when using the view button. If you were affected, updating to v3.8.4 restores the expected behavior.
