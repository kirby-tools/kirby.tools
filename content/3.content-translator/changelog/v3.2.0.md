**♻️ Refactorings**

- **Option renamed: `bulk` → `batch`**: The `bulk` configuration option has been renamed to [`batch`](/docs/content-translator/configuration/local#batch) for clearer terminology. The old `bulk` option name continues to work for backward compatibility, but we recommend updating your blueprints to use `batch` for consistency with the documentation.
