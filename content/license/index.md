## License Summary (non-binding)

This summary is provided for convenience only. **The full Agreement below is legally binding and controls** in case of any conflict.

This Agreement applies to the proprietary Kirby Tools plugin(s) ("Plugins") by Johann Schopplich ("Licensor") that you purchase or otherwise lawfully obtain from the Licensor or an Authorized Reseller (e.g. Lemon Squeezy), unless you have a separate written agreement with the Licensor.

**Each Plugin is licensed separately.** Purchasing a license for one Plugin does not grant rights to any other Plugin.

### Key Permissions

- Use the Plugins on an **unlimited number of Projects** **only if** you are the **Code Owner** of those Projects ("Owned Projects").
- Use the Plugins in **development, staging, and production** for those Owned Projects.
- **Modify** the Plugins for use within those Owned Projects.
- Allow employees/contractors/service providers to use the Plugins **on your behalf** for those Owned Projects.

### Client Work (Important)

- You may deliver a Project to a Client **only if you remain the Code Owner**.
- If the Client becomes the Code Owner (e.g. assignment/work-for-hire/exclusive license), the Client needs **their own Plugin license** (or you must remove the Plugin before handover).

### SaaS / Multi-tenant Use (Important)

Using a single Plugin license to provide the Plugins' functionality to **multiple third parties/tenants** as part of a SaaS/platform/website-builder offering is **not covered** by the "unlimited Owned Projects" permission. **Each tenant/customer Project requires its own Plugin license.**

### Key Restrictions

- **No redistribution or public sharing:** you may not share, publish, or redistribute the Plugins' source files (modified or unmodified), including in public repositories, starter kits, themes, or marketplace products.
- **No license key sharing** except as expressly permitted by this Agreement, and **no circumvention** of license checks/activation.

## 1. About This Agreement

This License Agreement ("Agreement") outlines the terms and conditions for the use of the Plugins.

By purchasing, downloading, installing, copying, accessing, or using any of the Plugins, you agree to comply with this Agreement.

In this Agreement, "you" refers to the Licensee and any person who accesses or uses the Plugins under the Licensee's authority (e.g. employees, contractors, or service providers).

## 2. Definitions

- **"Licensor"** means Johann Schopplich (kirby.tools).
- **"Licensee"** means the individual or legal entity that purchased the Plugins (or was designated as the license holder during purchase).
- **"Authorized Reseller"** means a reseller authorized by the Licensor to sell the Plugins (e.g. Lemon Squeezy).
- **"Plugin"** means a single proprietary Kirby Tools plugin product, such as Kirby Content Translator, Kirby Copilot, Kirby SEO Audit, or any other Kirby Tools plugin sold under this Agreement.
- **"Plugins"** means the Plugin(s) that you lawfully obtained under this Agreement (including any updates you are entitled to).
- **"License Key"** means a license key or token issued for a Plugin, which may be required for activation and may determine which versions you can use.
- **"Licensed Versions"** means the versions of a Plugin that your License Key entitles you to use, as determined by the purchase terms and/or as displayed and validated in the Licensor's licensing system (e.g. the Kirby Tools Hub). Licensed Versions may depend on the License Key generation and/or the purchase terms.
- **"Project"** means a single Kirby CMS project defined by its domain name and root directory (e.g. `https://sub.example.com` or `https://example.com/example/`). Each (sub)domain and root directory is a separate Project, even if the projects are related in any way.  
  **Exception:** If you use Kirby's cross-domain multi-language feature with the same content folder, those domains count as the same Project.  
  You may use Kirby as a headless backend or as a static site generator. In these cases, the Project is defined by the domain and root directory of the user- or visitor-facing frontend(s).
- **"Client"** means a third party for whom the Licensee develops a Project.
- **"Code Owner" / "Owned Project"** means the Licensee owns or controls the intellectual property rights in the custom source code of the Project (i.e. has the legal right to license, transfer, and control that code).  
  If you assign the Project code to a Client (including work-for-hire) or grant a Client an exclusive license to the Project code, the Client is considered the Code Owner for purposes of this Agreement, and the Project is **not** an Owned Project.
- **"Major Version"** means a release that increments the first digit of a semantic version (e.g. `2.x → 3.x`). Minor and patch versions follow semantic versioning.
- **"SaaS Offering"** means providing access to the Plugins' functionality to third parties as part of a hosted service, platform, website builder, managed service, or similar arrangement.
- **"Tenant Project"** means a Project within a SaaS Offering that is primarily operated for or benefits a specific third party customer/tenant.

## 3. Payment Processing

Payments for the Plugins may be processed by the Licensor and/or by an Authorized Reseller acting as Merchant of Record (e.g. Lemon Squeezy). Billing and checkout are handled by the Merchant of Record under their terms and policies.

## 4. Grant of License

Subject to your continued compliance with this Agreement, the Licensor grants the Licensee a **non-exclusive, non-transferable, worldwide, perpetual (subject to termination)** license to install and use the **Licensed Versions** of the Plugins on an **unlimited number of Owned Projects**.

This Agreement grants rights only for the specific Plugin(s) you obtained under it.

This license includes use in development, staging, and production environments for those Owned Projects and allows you to make reasonable copies solely for those purposes (e.g. for deployment and backups).

You may modify the Plugins for use within your Owned Projects, provided you do not distribute the Plugins except as explicitly permitted by this Agreement.

## 5. Licensed Versions, Updates, and Upgrades

Your license covers the **Licensed Versions** of the Plugin.

- **Updates (included):** Minor and patch updates for your Licensed Versions are included.
- **Upgrades (may be paid):** Access to a new Major Version may require purchasing an upgrade or a new license.

**Minimum entitlement:** At minimum, your purchase entitles you to use the Major Version of the Plugin that is made available for purchase at the time you buy it, plus minor and patch updates within that Major Version.

In case of ambiguity or conflict, the Licensed Versions shown and/or validated by the Licensor's licensing system control.

## 6. License Keys, Activation, and Verification

Some Plugins may require a License Key and may verify license status (for example to activate, validate eligibility for certain versions, or prevent abuse).

You agree that you will not:

- share, publish, sell, or disclose License Keys except as expressly permitted by this Agreement;
- circumvent, disable, or interfere with license checks or activation mechanisms, if any.

The Licensor may suspend or deactivate License Keys in the event of refunds/chargebacks (see "Refund Policy") or in the event of a breach of this Agreement, to the extent permitted by law.

## 7. Use by Employees, Contractors, and Service Providers

The Licensee may allow its employees and individual contractors to use the Plugins **solely on behalf of the Licensee** and only for the Licensee's Owned Projects, provided the Licensee remains responsible for their compliance with this Agreement.

The Licensee may also provide access to the Plugins to service providers (e.g. hosting providers) **solely to develop, deploy, host, or operate** the Licensee's Owned Projects.

## 8. Client Projects and Code Ownership

You may use the Plugins in a Project delivered to a Client only if the Project remains an **Owned Project**.

The Client may use the Plugins **only as integrated into that Owned Project** and solely for the purpose of operating and maintaining that Owned Project. The Client may not extract, reuse, or redistribute the Plugins (or any substantial portion of them) for any other Project or purpose.

If at any time the Client (or any third party) becomes the **Code Owner** of the Project (including via assignment, work-for-hire, or an exclusive license to the Project code), you must, before that transfer takes effect, either:

- ensure the new Code Owner obtains their own license for the Plugins, or
- remove the Plugins from the deliverable and cease all use under your license for that Project.

## 9. SaaS / Service Bureau Use

You may not use a single Plugin license (including a single License Key) to operate a **SaaS Offering** that makes the Plugins available to or primarily benefits **multiple third parties/tenants**.

If you operate a SaaS Offering, **each Tenant Project requires its own Plugin license** (i.e. a separate license purchase for the Plugins used for that Tenant Project), unless the Licensor has granted you a separate written agreement covering that use.

## 10. Restrictions

The Licensee may not, and may not permit others to:

- **distribute, sell, lease, sublicense, or otherwise make available** the Plugins (modified or unmodified) to any third party, except as explicitly permitted for employees/contractors/service providers and Client access under this Agreement;
- publish the Plugins (or substantial portions of them) in any public or third-party repository, template, starter kit, theme, or marketplace product;
- remove, obscure, or alter copyright notices, license notices, or proprietary markings;
- circumvent or disable license checks or activation mechanisms, if any;
- reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble the Plugins, except to the extent expressly permitted by applicable law notwithstanding this limitation.

Any use outside these restrictions is strictly prohibited and may result in termination of this Agreement.

## 11. Ownership and Intellectual Property <!-- SHARED: KT-COMMON-OWNERSHIP -->

The Plugins are copyrighted by the Licensor. All rights not expressly granted to the Licensee are retained by the Licensor, including all intellectual property rights.

## 12. Third-Party Components and Services

Some components used by the Plugins may be provided under separate open-source or third-party licenses. Those licenses apply to the respective components.

Some Plugins may integrate with third-party services (e.g. APIs). Your use of such services may be subject to separate terms and privacy policies of those third parties.

## 13. Disclaimer of Affiliation <!-- SHARED: KT-COMMON-AFFILIATION -->

The Plugins are independent products and are not affiliated with the developers of Kirby CMS. Trademarks used are owned by their respective trademark holders and do not imply endorsement.

## 14. Support

Unless otherwise stated on the product page and/or checkout page at the time of purchase (or in a separate written agreement), no specific response time or guaranteed support scope is promised under this Agreement.

## 15. Refund Policy

A 30-day money-back guarantee applies to the Plugins, unless mandatory local law provides otherwise.

### Effect of Refunds, Chargebacks, and Payment Reversals

If a purchase is refunded, disputed, charged back, or otherwise reversed, the corresponding license is terminated. The Licensee must immediately cease all use of the affected Plugin(s) and delete all copies in their possession or control. The Licensor may deactivate the associated License Key(s).

## 16. Disclaimer of Warranty <!-- SHARED: KT-COMMON-WARRANTY -->

**THE PLUGINS ARE PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE".**

Except where prohibited by law, the Licensor disclaims all warranties of any kind, whether express or implied, including but not limited to implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement.

You are solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using the Plugins and for implementing appropriate safeguards (including backups). The Plugins may contain errors and may cause interruptions, data loss, incompatibilities, or other issues. You assume all risks associated with installing and using the Plugins.

Nothing in this Agreement excludes, restricts, or modifies any mandatory consumer rights that cannot be waived under applicable law.

## 17. Limitation of Liability

Except where prohibited by law, the Licensor shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or exemplary damages, including but not limited to damages for loss of profits, goodwill, use, data, or other intangible losses, even if advised of the possibility of such damages.

Where liability cannot be excluded under applicable law (for example, for intent, gross negligence, or injury to life, body, or health), this Agreement does not exclude such liability.

Except where prohibited by law, the Licensor's total cumulative liability arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall not exceed the total fees paid by the Licensee for the Plugin(s) giving rise to the claim.

## 18. Indemnification <!-- SHARED: KT-COMMON-INDEMNIFICATION -->

Except where prohibited by law, the Licensee agrees to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the Licensor from any claims, damages, losses, or expenses (including reasonable legal fees) incurred due to the Licensee's misuse of the Plugins or violation of this Agreement.

## 19. Termination

This Agreement is effective until terminated.

The Licensor may terminate this Agreement (including the license for one or more affected Plugin(s)) if the Licensee breaches any term of this Agreement and does not remedy the breach within fourteen (14) days of written notice. The Licensor may terminate immediately for material breaches that cannot be cured (e.g. unauthorized distribution or public sharing of the Plugins or License Keys, or circumvention of licensing).

Upon termination, the Licensee must immediately cease all use of the affected Plugin(s) and delete all copies in their possession or control.

### Survival

Sections 4 (to the extent relating to restrictions on License Keys), 10–18, 20–22, and this Section 19 (Survival) survive termination.

## 20. General Provisions

### Entire Agreement; Severability

This Agreement constitutes the entire understanding between the parties regarding the Plugins. If any part of this Agreement is declared unenforceable or invalid, the remainder will continue to be valid and enforceable.

### Assignment

The Licensee may not assign or transfer this Agreement or the license granted under it without the Licensor's prior written consent, **except** to a successor entity in connection with a merger, acquisition, or sale of substantially all of the Licensee's assets, provided that (a) the successor agrees in writing to be bound by this Agreement and (b) the Licensee provides notice to the Licensor.

### No Third-Party Beneficiaries

This Agreement is solely between the Licensor and the Licensee and does not confer any rights or remedies on any third party. Authorized Resellers and the developers of Kirby CMS are not parties to this Agreement and assume no obligations or liability under it.

### Changes to This Agreement

The Licensor may amend this Agreement from time to time by publishing an updated version.

Changes will apply immediately to new purchases. For existing Licensees, changes apply when downloading, installing, activating, or using updates released after the effective date of the updated Agreement.

For businesses/merchants, the place of jurisdiction for all disputes arising out of or in connection with this Agreement is Leipzig, Germany.

Any disputes arising from this Agreement shall be resolved through mediation, if possible, before resorting to litigation.

## 22. Data Protection <!-- SHARED: KT-COMMON-DATA-PROTECTION -->
