## License Summary (non-binding)

This summary is provided for convenience and readability only. **The full Agreement below is legally binding and controls** in case of any conflict.

This **Zero One Edition** license applies to proprietary Kirby Tools plugin(s) by Johann Schopplich ("Licensor") that are distributed together with the "Zero One" Kirby CMS Theme ("Zero One Theme") by The Zero / thezero.club ("Theme Seller").

You may use the Plugins **only within End Products built with the Zero One Theme** (including modified versions) and **only while the relevant End Product is covered by a Valid Theme License**. The number of permitted End Products is limited by the Theme License (e.g. "up to three projects", depending on the Theme License terms).

The Zero One Edition Plugins may be distributed without a separate Kirby Tools license key or activation step. The absence of licensing/activation logic does not expand the scope of permitted use: the Plugins remain proprietary and may be used only as expressly permitted by this Agreement.

### Key Permissions

- Use the Plugins only within **End Products** based on the Zero One Theme (including modified versions).
- Use the Plugins in development, staging, and production for those End Products.
- Modify the Plugins for use within those End Products.
- Deliver an End Product to a Client; the Client may operate the End Product but may not extract or reuse the Plugins elsewhere.

### Key Restrictions

- **No standalone use:** you may not use the Plugins outside End Products based on the Zero One Theme.
- **No redistribution or public sharing:** you may not share, publish, or redistribute the Plugins' source files (modified or unmodified), including in public repositories or by bundling them with other themes/starter kits.
- **No circumvention:** you may not bypass edition checks or other technical measures.

## 1. About This License Agreement

This License Agreement ("Agreement") outlines the terms and conditions for the use of the Kirby Tools plugins distributed as the "Zero One Edition" ("Plugins").

By downloading, installing, copying, accessing, or using any of the Plugins, you agree to comply with this Agreement.

In this Agreement, "you" refers to the individual or legal entity that lawfully obtained access to the Plugins as part of the Zero One Theme package and any person who accesses or uses the Plugins under that entity's authority (e.g. employees, contractors, or service providers), solely for permitted End Products.

## 2. Definitions

- **"Licensor"** means Johann Schopplich (kirby.tools).
- **"Theme Seller"** means The Zero / thezero.club (or its designated reseller/merchant of record).
- **"Licensee"** means the individual or legal entity that lawfully obtained the Zero One Theme package containing the Plugins (or that is otherwise covered by a Valid Theme License for the relevant End Product(s)).
- **"Zero One Theme"** means the "Zero One" Kirby CMS theme distributed by the Theme Seller.
- **"Theme License"** means the license terms under which the Zero One Theme is provided to end users by the Theme Seller.
- **"Valid Theme License"** means a Theme License that:
  - (a) was lawfully obtained from the Theme Seller (or its designated reseller/merchant of record),
  - (b) has not been revoked, terminated, refunded, reversed, disputed, or charged back, and
  - (c) under its terms at the relevant time, covers the creation and/or operation of the relevant End Product(s) (including any project-count limits, subscription terms, or lifetime rights).

  For avoidance of doubt: if the Theme License is time-limited (e.g. annual access to updates), it remains a Valid Theme License for an End Product after expiry **only if and for so long as** the Theme License terms permit continued operation of that End Product using previously downloaded versions of the Zero One Theme (but may not entitle you to updates).

- **"Plugins"** means the proprietary Kirby CMS plugin(s) authored by the Licensor and distributed as part of the Zero One Edition. As of December 2025, the Zero One Edition includes: Kirby SEO Audit. The Licensor may update this list for future distributions.
- **"End Product"** means a website or other deliverable built with Kirby CMS that is based on the Zero One Theme (including modified/derived versions) and that incorporates the Plugins as part of that project.
- **"Client"** means a third party for whom an End Product is created or delivered.

## 3. Relationship to the Zero One Theme License

The Zero One Theme is licensed separately by the Theme Seller. This Agreement governs only the Plugins.

Your rights to use the Plugins under this Agreement are conditional upon:

1. your compliance with this Agreement, and
2. the existence of a **Valid Theme License** covering the relevant End Product(s).

If there is a direct conflict between this Agreement and the Theme License regarding the Plugins, **this Agreement controls for the Plugins**.

## 4. Payment Processing (Zero One Edition)

The Plugins are provided to you as part of your acquisition of the Zero One Theme from the Theme Seller. The Licensor is **not** the merchant of record for theme purchases.

For questions about billing, invoices, payment processing, order delivery, or download access for the Zero One Theme package, please contact the Theme Seller (see "Contact Information").

## 5. Grant of License

Subject to your continued compliance with this Agreement and the existence of a Valid Theme License covering the relevant End Product(s), the Licensor grants you a **non-exclusive, non-transferable, worldwide** license to use the Plugins solely:

- as part of End Products, and
- only to the extent the applicable Theme License permits creation and/or operation of those End Products.

This license allows use of the Plugins in development, staging, and production environments related to those End Products.

You may modify the Plugins for use within those End Products, provided you comply with the restrictions in this Agreement.

### No Separate License Key / Activation

The Zero One Edition Plugins may operate without a Kirby Tools license key or activation step. No license key is granted under this Agreement, and the absence of activation requirements does not permit any use beyond the scope of this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, the absence of activation mechanisms does not modify Section 8 (Restrictions), including the prohibition on bypassing edition checks.

## 6. Client Delivery (End Product Recipients)

You may deliver an End Product to a Client.

The Client may use the Plugins **only as integrated into that End Product** and solely for the purpose of operating and maintaining that End Product, and only while that End Product is covered by a Valid Theme License.

The Client may not extract, reuse, or redistribute the Plugins (or any substantial portion of them) for any other project or purpose.

## 7. Authorized Distribution

The Licensor authorizes the Theme Seller to distribute the Plugins **only** as part of the Zero One Theme package.

Except for this authorized distribution channel, **no distribution rights are granted** under this Agreement. Any other distribution requires the Licensor's prior written permission.

## 8. Restrictions

You may not, and may not permit others to:

- use the Plugins in any project that is not an End Product;
- distribute, sell, lease, sublicense, publish, or otherwise make available the Plugins (modified or unmodified) to any third party, except as incorporated into an End Product as allowed by this Agreement;
- publish the Plugins (or substantial portions of them) in any public repository, template, starter kit, theme, or marketplace product;
- remove, obscure, or alter copyright notices, license notices, or proprietary markings;
- bypass or defeat any mechanism intended to control access or usage (including any mechanism intended to ensure the Plugins are used only with the Zero One Theme);
- reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble the Plugins, except to the extent such restriction is prohibited by applicable law.

Any use outside these restrictions is strictly prohibited and may result in termination of this Agreement.

## 9. Ownership and Intellectual Property <!-- SHARED: KT-COMMON-OWNERSHIP -->

The Plugins are copyrighted by the Licensor. All rights not expressly granted to you are retained by the Licensor, including all intellectual property rights.

## 10. Third-Party Components and Services

Some components used by the Plugins may be provided under separate open-source or third-party licenses. Those licenses apply to the respective components.

Some Plugins may integrate with third-party services (e.g. APIs). Your use of such services may be subject to separate terms and privacy policies of those third parties.

## 11. Disclaimer of Affiliation <!-- SHARED: KT-COMMON-AFFILIATION -->

The Plugins are independent products and are not affiliated with the developers of Kirby CMS. Trademarks used are owned by their respective trademark holders and do not imply endorsement.

## 12. Updates and Support

Updates (if any) to the Zero One Edition Plugins are delivered **only via Zero One Theme updates** provided by the Theme Seller.

No specific update cadence, response time, or guaranteed support scope is promised under this Agreement unless explicitly stated in writing.

## 13. Refunds, Chargebacks, and Loss of Theme License

If a Theme License is refunded, reversed, disputed, charged back, or otherwise becomes invalid such that it is no longer a Valid Theme License for an End Product, you must immediately cease all use of the Plugins for that End Product and delete all copies in your possession or control.

## 14. Disclaimer of Warranty <!-- SHARED: KT-COMMON-WARRANTY -->

**THE PLUGINS ARE PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE".**

Except where prohibited by law, the Licensor disclaims all warranties of any kind, whether express or implied, including but not limited to implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement.

You are solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using the Plugins and for implementing appropriate safeguards (including backups). The Plugins may contain errors and may cause interruptions, data loss, incompatibilities, or other issues. You assume all risks associated with installing and using the Plugins.

Nothing in this Agreement excludes, restricts, or modifies any mandatory consumer rights that cannot be waived under applicable law.

## 15. Limitation of Liability

Except where prohibited by law, the Licensor shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or exemplary damages, including but not limited to damages for loss of profits, goodwill, use, data, or other intangible losses, even if advised of the possibility of such damages.

Where liability cannot be excluded under applicable law (for example, for intent, gross negligence, or injury to life, body, or health), this Agreement does not exclude such liability.

Except where prohibited by law, in no event will the Licensor's total cumulative liability arising out of or relating to this Agreement exceed **EUR 99**.

## 16. Indemnification <!-- SHARED: KT-COMMON-INDEMNIFICATION -->

Except where prohibited by law, you agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the Licensor from any claims, damages, losses, or expenses (including reasonable legal fees) incurred due to your misuse of the Plugins or violation of this Agreement.

## 17. Termination

This Agreement is effective until terminated.

The Licensor may terminate this Agreement if you breach any term of this Agreement and do not remedy the breach within fourteen (14) days of written notice. The Licensor may terminate immediately for material breaches that cannot be cured (e.g. unauthorized distribution or public sharing of the Plugins, or circumvention of edition checks).

Upon termination, you must immediately cease all use of the Plugins and delete all copies in your possession or control.

### Survival

Sections 5 (to the extent relating to restrictions and limitations), 8–16, 18–20, and this Section 17 (Survival) survive termination.

## 18. General Provisions

### Entire Agreement; Severability

This Agreement constitutes the entire understanding between the parties regarding the Plugins (Zero One Edition). If any part of this Agreement is declared unenforceable or invalid, the remainder will continue to be valid and enforceable.

### Assignment

You may not assign or transfer this Agreement or the license granted under it without the Licensor's prior written consent, **except** to a successor entity in connection with a merger, acquisition, or sale of substantially all assets, provided that the successor agrees in writing to be bound by this Agreement.

### No Third-Party Beneficiaries

This Agreement is solely between you and the Licensor and does not confer any rights or remedies on any third party. In particular, the Theme Seller, any merchant of record or payment processor, and the developers of Kirby CMS are not parties to this Agreement and assume no obligations or liability under it.

### Changes to This Agreement

The Licensor may amend this Agreement from time to time by publishing an updated version.

Changes will apply immediately to new users and new distributions. For existing users, changes apply when downloading, installing, copying, accessing, or using an updated version of the Plugins released after the effective date of the updated Agreement (for example as part of a Zero One Theme update).

Except as described above, your use of previously downloaded versions of the Plugins remains governed by the version of this Agreement in effect when you obtained those versions.

## 19. Governing Law & Place of Jurisdiction <!-- SHARED: KT-COMMON-GOVERNING-LAW -->

This Agreement is governed by the laws of Germany.

If you are a consumer, mandatory consumer protection laws applicable in your country of habitual residence may also apply and remain unaffected.

For businesses/merchants, the place of jurisdiction for all disputes arising out of or in connection with this Agreement is Leipzig, Germany.

Any disputes arising from this Agreement shall be resolved through mediation, if possible, before resorting to litigation.

## 20. Data Protection <!-- SHARED: KT-COMMON-DATA-PROTECTION -->
