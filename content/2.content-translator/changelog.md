## Where to Find the Latest Version?

If you have installed the plugin via Composer, you can update it by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
composer update
```

If you have downloaded the plugin as a ZIP file before, download the :latest-version and replace the existing plugin folder in your `site/plugins` directory with the new one.
