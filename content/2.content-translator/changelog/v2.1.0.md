**🚀 Features**

- **Field-level translation control**: Skip translating specific fields by setting `translate: false` in your blueprint field options. This is useful for fields that contain code, identifiers, or other content that should remain unchanged across languages.

```yaml [blueprint.yml]
fields:
  code:
    type: textarea
    translate: false # This field will not be translated
```

- **Improved button labels**: Translation button texts have been updated to more clearly indicate their action (Import/Translate).
