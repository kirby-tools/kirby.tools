**🚀 Features**

- **Improved HTML translation**: Enabled HTML handling for DeepL API requests, ensuring HTML content (like rich text with formatting) is translated correctly while preserving tags and structure.
- **Markdown Field plugin support**: Added compatibility with the community-driven [Markdown Field plugin](https://github.com/fabianmichael/kirby-markdown-field) by Fabian Michael. Markdown content is now properly handled during translation.
- **Custom DeepL options**: The new [`DeepL.requestOptions`](/docs/content-translator/configuration/global#deepl-api-configuration) configuration option lets you set custom request options for the DeepL API, such as formality level or specific glossary IDs.
