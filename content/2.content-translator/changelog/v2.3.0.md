**🚀 Features**

- New [`translateSlug`](/docs/content-translator/usage/php-api#translateslug) PHP API method.
- [Batch translation mode](/docs/content-translator/configuration/section#batch): The content of all secondary languages is overwritten with the data of the default language and then translated into the respective language.

::

Unlike per-language translation, this translation process **is not reversible** in the Panel and is handled server-side. Use it with caution, as it may take a while to translate all content. When the button is clicked, a confirmation dialog is displayed to prevent accidental batch translation.

::note
If this new feature breaks your workflow, you can disable it by setting `batch: false` in the plugin configuration.

When disabled, the section will look the same as in v2.2.0 and earlier versions:

**🐞 Bug Fixes**

- Disallow changing the slug on the homepage page ID.
