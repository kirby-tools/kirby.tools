Major performance overhaul! Batch translation is now enabled by default when using DeepL, eliminating single API requests and dramatically improving translation speed. Up to 50 texts can now be translated in a single request to DeepL.

- Texts are now sent to DeepL in [chunks for translation](https://developers.deepl.com/api-reference/translate#translating-large-volumes-of-text) by default when no custom translator function is set. This significantly improves performance by reducing the number of API calls to DeepL.
