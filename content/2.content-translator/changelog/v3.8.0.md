- **Batch translation by default**: Texts are now sent to DeepL in [batches for translation](https://developers.deepl.com/api-reference/translate#translating-large-volumes-of-text) by default when no custom translator function is set. This significantly improves performance by reducing the number of API calls to DeepL.
