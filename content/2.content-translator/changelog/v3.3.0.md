**ðŸš€ Features**

- Use the language's `LC_ALL` locale (if available) to resolve the DeepL target language.
- Validate language code against DeepL's supported target languages.

For example, if you set `LC_ALL` to `en_UK`, the target language for DeepL will still be `EN`, since `EN-UK` is not supported by DeepL. If you set `LC_ALL` to `en_GB` instead, then the Content Translator will send `EN-GB` as the target language to DeepL.
