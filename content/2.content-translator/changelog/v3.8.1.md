**🚀 Features**

- **View button theming**: Customize the appearance of the Content Translator view button with the new `theme` prop. Available themes match Kirby's button styles (e.g., `positive`, `negative`, `blue-icon`).

**🐞 Bug Fixes**

- **Respect `translate: false` in blocks**: Fields marked with `translate: false` inside blocks are now correctly skipped during content synchronization (import). Previously, these fields were being imported even when marked as non-translatable, causing unwanted content overwrites.
