**🚀 Features**

- **Tags field translation**: The [`tags` field type](https://getkirby.com/docs/reference/panel/fields/tags) is now supported for translation. Each tag value is translated individually while preserving the comma-separated structure. This is useful for translating categories, labels, or keywords stored in tags fields.
