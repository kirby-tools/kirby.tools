**🐞 Bug Fixes**

- **Blueprint options in batch mode**: Section-specific blueprint options (such as `excludeFields`, `title`, `slug`) are now correctly applied during batch translations. Previously, these options were ignored when using batch translation mode, causing all fields to be translated regardless of exclusions. This fix ensures your per-section configuration is respected in both single and batch translation modes.
