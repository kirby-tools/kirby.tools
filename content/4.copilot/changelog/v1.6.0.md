**ðŸš¨ Breaking Changes**

As of April 2024, OpenAI has added vision capabilities to the GPT-4 Turbo model. Following this change, the configuration for the OpenAI provider has been simplified to only include the model name.

To update your configuration from Kirby Copilot v1.5 and earlier to the latest version, reduce the `model` configuration to only include the model name:

```diff
return [
    'johannschopplich.copilot' => [
        'providers' => [
            'openai' => [
-                'model' => [
-                    'default' => 'gpt-4-turbo-preview',
-                    'vision' => 'gpt-4-vision-preview'
-                ]
+                'model' => 'gpt-4-turbo'
            ]
        ]
    ]
];
```

**ðŸš€ Features**

- Migrate from ModelFusion to Vercel's [AI SDK Core](https://sdk.vercel.ai/docs/ai-sdk-core).
- Set `gpt-4-turbo` as default OpenAI model.
