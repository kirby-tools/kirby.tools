**🚀 Features**

- **Dynamic prompts with Kirby queries**: The [`userPrompt`](/docs/copilot/configuration/local#userprompt) and [`systemPrompt`](/docs/copilot/configuration/local#systemprompt) section properties now support Kirby queries. This allows you to dynamically generate prompts based on page content, site settings, or other data. For example, use `{{ page.title }}` to include the page title in your prompt.
