**🚨 Breaking Changes**

As of April 2024, OpenAI has added vision capabilities to the GPT-4 Turbo model. Following this change, the configuration for the OpenAI provider has been simplified to only include the model name.

**🚀 Features**

- **AI SDK migration**: Migrate from ModelFusion to Vercel's [AI SDK Core](https://ai-sdk.dev/docs/ai-sdk-core).
- **New default model**: Set `gpt-4-turbo` as default OpenAI model.
