**🚀 Features**

- **GPT-4o as default model**: The default OpenAI model is now `gpt-4o`, which combines strong reasoning capabilities with native vision support for image understanding. This model offers improved performance over GPT-4 Turbo at a lower cost. You can still configure a different model in the [provider configuration](/docs/copilot/configuration/global#model).
