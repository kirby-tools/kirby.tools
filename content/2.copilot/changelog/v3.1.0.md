**🚀 Features**

- **Dynamic API key resolution**: The `apiKey` option now accepts closures for dynamic key resolution at runtime. The closure receives the Kirby instance as its first argument, enabling user-specific or context-dependent API keys. See the [Global Configuration documentation](/docs/copilot/configuration/global#dynamic-api-keys).
- **Localized prompt templates**: Default prompt templates are now available in English, German, French, and Dutch. Templates are automatically selected based on the Panel user's language setting.
