**🐞 Bug Fixes**

- **Content-Type header forwarding**: The server-side proxy now correctly forwards the `Content-Type` header to AI providers. Previously, the missing header caused request bodies to be misinterpreted as form data instead of JSON.
- **Long AI generation handling**: Improved proxy stability for extended AI generations. The timeout window has been increased from 120 to 240 seconds, and output buffering is now properly disabled to prevent truncated responses during lengthy operations.
