## Quick Start

### Step 1: Install the Plugin

:prose-video{src="/vid/kirby-tools-hub-license.mp4" poster="/vid/kirby-tools-hub-license-poster.jpg" width="908" height="540"}

#### Composer :u-badge{label="v1.2.1+" class="align-middle ml-2 !rounded-full" variant="subtle"}

The easiest and recommended way to install the plugin is via Composer. A private repository provided by us is required to install the plugin. Authentication is done via a license code that you receive from the Kirby Tools Hub after your purchase.

To get access to the private repository, follow these steps:

1. Go to [hub.kirby.tools](https://hub.kirby.tools). Log in with the email you used for the purchase and the order number.
2. After successful login, a license code will be displayed next to the Composer repository configuration.
3. Copy and paste the Composer configuration and paste it into your `composer.json` file.

Your `composer.json` file should look something like this:

```json [composer.json]
{
  "repositories": [
    {
      "type": "composer",
      "url": "https://repo.kirby.tools",
      "options": {
        "http": {
          "header": ["X-License: KT1-gd9Ymx30rM-ylZ3h6yF3l"]
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

The license code is unique to your purchase and should be kept private. Do not share it with anyone.
::

The Kirby Tools Composer repository is now set up. You can install the plugin by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
composer require johannschopplich/kirby-live-preview
```

For multiple plugins to be installed from the Kirby Tools Composer repository, include all license codes in the repository `header`. Separate each license code with a comma, e.g. `X-License: KT1-A, KT1-B`.

#### Download

After your purchase, you will receive a download link for the Kirby Live Preview plugin. Download the ZIP file and extract it to your `site/plugins` folder. It should look like this:

```
site/plugins/
├─ kirby-live-preview/
│  ├─ index.js
│  ├─ index.php
│  ├─ … other plugin files
```

### Step 2: Blueprint Setup

Select a site or page blueprint to which you want to add the Live Preview section. Add the following section configuration to the blueprint file:

```yaml [pages/default.yml]
sections:
  livePreview:
    type: preview
```

### Step 3: Enjoy Real-Time Previews

Fit the Live Preview section to your blueprint layout and customize it to your needs: It can be part of any column and can even be sticky. The latter is useful for previewing content changes side-by-side with blocks or other fields:

```yaml [pages/default.yml]
columns:
  - width: 2/3
    fields:
      blocks:
        type: blocks

  - width: 1/3
    # Make the preview sticky
    sticky: true
    sections:
      livePreview:
        type: preview
```

Now you see a rendering of the page content. It updates as you type:

![Kirby Live Preview panel example](/img/kirby-live-preview-panel-example.png)

Try navigating through the preview – if you click on a site link, such as in the header, the corresponding Panel page will open instead of the link in the preview.

For mor configuration options, see the [Configuration](/docs/live-preview/configuration) guide.
