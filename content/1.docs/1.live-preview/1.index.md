## Quick Start

### Step 1: Install the Plugin

#### Download

After your purchase, you will receive a download link for the Kirby Live Preview plugin. Download the ZIP file and extract it to your `site/plugins` folder. It should look like this:

```
site/plugins/
├─ kirby-live-preview/
│  ├─ … All plugin files
```

#### Composer :u-badge{label="v1.2.1+" class="align-middle ml-2 !rounded-full" variant="subtle"}

The recommended way to install the plugin is via Composer. Since it's not available through Packagist, you have to connect to our private repository [repo.kirby.tools](https://repo.kirby.tools) and authenticate your package download. Authentication is done via a license code that you can get from the [Kirby Tools Hub](https://hub.kirby.tools) after your purchase.

To get access to the private repository and enable Composer installs, follow these steps:

1. Go to [hub.kirby.tools](https://hub.kirby.tools). Log in with the email you used for the purchase and the order number.
2. After successful login, a license code will be displayed next to the Composer repository configuration and a CLI command.
3. Copy and paste the Composer configuration into your `composer.json` file. This will enable Composer to resolve our plugins. Your `composer.json` file should include this repository item:
   ```json [composer.json]
   {
     "repositories": [
       {
         "type": "composer",
         "url": "https://repo.kirby.tools"
       }
     ]
   }
   ```
4. Copy and run the Composer CLI command, which generates a `auth.json` file for you, a Composer standard to authenticate against private repositories. Composer will send your license key (or license keys if you have purchased multiple plugins) as a bearer token with each request to `repo.kirby.tools`. Alternatively to running the command, you can create the file yourself. A `auth.json` should look like this:
   ```json [auth.json]
   {
     "bearer": {
       "repo.kirby.tools": "KT1-gd9Ymx30rM-ylZ3h6yF3l"
     }
   }
   ```

For multiple plugins to be installed in a Kirby project, add all required license codes to your local `auth.json` file. Separate each license code with a comma, e.g.:

```json [auth.json]
{
  "bearer": {
    "repo.kirby.tools": "KT1-A, KT1-B"
  }
}
```

The license code is unique to your purchase and should be kept private. We recommend to exclude it from version control by adding it to your `.gitignore` file.

The Kirby Tools Composer repository is now set up. You can install the plugin by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
composer require johannschopplich/kirby-live-preview
```

Now you can manage the Kirby Live Preview plugin just like any other plugin, e.g. fetch updated versions:

```bash
composer update
```

### Step 2: Blueprint Setup

Select a site or page blueprint to which you want to add the Live Preview section. Add the following section configuration to the blueprint file:

```yaml [pages/default.yml]
sections:
  livePreview:
    type: preview
```

### Step 3: Enjoy Real-Time Previews

Fit the Live Preview section to your blueprint layout and customize it to your needs: It can be part of any column and can even be sticky. The latter is useful for previewing content changes side-by-side with blocks or other fields:

```yaml [pages/default.yml]
columns:
  - width: 2/3
    fields:
      blocks:
        type: blocks

  - width: 1/3
    # Make the preview sticky
    sticky: true
    sections:
      livePreview:
        type: preview
```

Now you see a rendering of the page content. It updates as you type:

![Kirby Live Preview panel example](/img/kirby-live-preview-panel-example.png)

Try navigating through the preview – if you click on a site link, such as in the header, the corresponding Panel page will open instead of the link in the preview.

For mor configuration options, see the [Configuration](/docs/live-preview/configuration) guide.
