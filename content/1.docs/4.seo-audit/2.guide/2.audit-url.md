You might be wondering how the Kirby SEO Audit plugin knows which URL to process? The answer is simple: it retrieves the `previewUrl` of the current Kirby page model. This means that the URL used to generate the SEO report is the same as the one opened by clicking the preview button in the Panel. Which means that draft pages can be SEO-checked as well.

The plugin fetches the HTML content of the preview URL, performs the SEO evaluation on it and generates the SEO report.

## Site vs. Page Level

Technically, the plugin works with any Kirby model. It uses the `previewUrl` method of the current mode (site, page or file). In the blueprint template you can customize this preview URL (see next section).

So you can use the plugin on pages and sites, and even change the URL per template if you need to.

## Custom Target URL

In certain cases, you might want to customize the target URL used to generate the SEO report for. This can be done by adding a `preview` field to the page's options in the blueprint:

```yaml [pages/default.yml]
options:
  preview: https://getkirby.com

sections:
  seoAudit:
    type: seo-audit
```

If the origin of the preview URL is not the same as the origin of the Panel, the plugin will fetch the HTML content through an internal proxy. This is necessary to avoid CORS issues.
