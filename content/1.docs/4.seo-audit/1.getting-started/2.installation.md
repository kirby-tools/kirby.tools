## Step 1: Install the Plugin

Although it is a commercial plugin, you can download and test the plugin in your local environment before purchasing it.

### Composer

The recommended way to install the plugin is via Composer. To install the plugin, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
composer require johannschopplich/kirby-seo-audit
```

### Download

Head over to the [releases page](https://github.com/kirby-tools/kirby-seo-audit/releases) and download the latest version of the plugin as a ZIP file. Extract the contents of this ZIP file to your `site/plugins` folder. It should look like this:

```
site/plugins/
├─ kirby-seo-audit/
│  └─ … All plugin files
```

## Step 2: Configuration

### View Button :u-badge{label="v3.0+" class="align-middle ml-2 !rounded-full" variant="subtle"}

Kirby 5 introduces new extensions that allow you to add custom view buttons to most Panel views (e.g. site, page, or file). The SEO Audit plugin provides a view button that can be added alongside the default Panel header buttons, such as the preview and settings buttons:

![Kirby SEO Audit Panel view button](/img/kirby-seo-audit-view-button.png)

Clicking the **SEO Audit** view button immediately runs a SEO and readability analysis for the current page and opens the results in a Panel dialog. It is as simple as that!

To add the `seo-audit` view button to a particular view, set the `buttons` option in the corresponding blueprint. The SEO Audit view button can be customized with the same configuration properties as the section:

::code-group

```yaml [site.yml]
buttons:
  seo-audit:
    keyphraseField: metaKeyphrase
    synonymsField: metaSynonyms
  open: true
  preview: true
```

```yaml [pages/default.yml]
buttons:
  seo-audit:
    keyphraseField: metaKeyphrase
    synonymsField: metaSynonyms
    assessments:
      - titleWidth
      - metaDescriptionLength
      - textLength
  open: true
  preview: true
  settings: true
  status: true
```

```yaml [files/default.yml]
buttons:
  seo-audit:
    keyphraseField: metaKeyphrase
    contentSelector: "#main"
  open: true
  settings: true
```

::

See the [configuration guide](/docs/seo-audit/configuration/local) for all available view button options.

::note
The `seo-audit` Panel view button is only supported in Kirby 5. If you are using Kirby 4, consider upgrading to Kirby 5 to take advantage of this feature.
::

### Section

The SEO Audit section gives you fine-grained control over which blueprints should have SEO analysis capabilities. This allows you to decide which content should be analyzed and customize the analysis parameters.

To add the SEO Audit section to a blueprint, include the following configuration:

```yaml [pages/default.yml]
sections:
  seoAudit:
    type: seo-audit
```

This is how the section will render in the Panel:

::preview{src="/img/kirby-seo-audit-section.png" alt="SEO audit section in Kirby Panel" width="1074" height="186"}
::

Click the **Analyze** button to perform a **SEO and readability analysis** on the current page. The analysis results are organized into three categories: Good, OK, and Bad, making it easy to prioritize optimization efforts:

::preview{src="/img/kirby-seo-audit-section-result.png" alt="SEO audit section showing categorized results" width="1074" height="1515"}
::

Note that during the testing process, a license notice will be displayed below the analysis section. You can remove this notice by purchasing a license.

## Step 3: Configure Keyphrase Fields (Optional)

SEO assessments that analyze how the keyphrase is used, such as Introduction Keyword, Meta Description or Keyword Function Words in Keyphrase, will only run with a defined keyphrase. You can define blueprint fields for the keyword and its synonyms to be analyzed with your page. These fields can be used by both the view button and section:

```yaml [pages/default.yml]
# Configure the view button to use keyphrase fields
buttons:
  seo-audit:
    keyphraseField: metaKeyphrase
    synonymsField: metaSynonyms
  preview: true
  settings: true
  status: true

sections:
  # Define the keyphrase fields
  content:
    type: fields
    fields:
      metaKeyphrase:
        label: SEO Keyphrase
        type: text
        help: The main keyword you want this page to rank for
      metaSynonyms:
        label: Keyphrase Synonyms
        type: tags
        help: Alternative keywords and variations

  # Configure the section to use the same fields
  seoAudit:
    type: seo-audit
    keyphraseField: metaKeyphrase
    synonymsField: metaSynonyms
```

::callout{icon="i-ri-information-line" color="info" to="/docs/seo-audit/configuration/local"}

## Step 4: Analyze Your Content

Open the Panel and navigate to the page that you want to analyze. You can start the SEO audit in two ways:

- **Using the View Button**: Click the **SEO Audit** view button and the SEO and readability analysis results will open in a Panel dialog.
- **Using the Section**: Click the **Analyze** button in the section to start the SEO audit. The analysis results will be displayed directly in the section.

When using the Panel view button, the analysis results will be displayed in a dialog:

![Kirby SEO Audit showing analysis results dialog](/img/kirby-seo-audit-analysis-results.png)

Both methods perform the same analysis process:

1. Fetch the HTML content from your [page's preview URL](/docs/seo-audit/guide/audit-url).
2. Analyze the content using 28 SEO and readability assessments.
3. Present results in four clear categories (Good, OK, Bad, Feedback) with actionable recommendations for improvement.

The analysis considers your defined keyphrase and synonyms to provide targeted optimization suggestions. All analysis runs locally in your browser, ensuring your data remains private and secure.

## Step 5: Buy a License

You can test the plugin locally. However, you need to purchase a license to use the plugin in production environments.

Visit the [product page on Lemon Squeezy](https://byjohann.lemonsqueezy.com/buy/639a814b-ca35-42db-9a40-026fc9274d60) and purchase a license. Then, open any Panel page that contains the SEO Audit section. Click the **Activate** link to open the activation form:

![Kirby SEO Audit activation](/img/kirby-seo-audit-activation.png)

Enter the email you used for the purchase and the order number and hit the submit button. Done! Thanks for supporting our work. Once you activate your license, the license activation buttons will disappear.

::note
Your license key will be automatically stored in the `/site/config/.kirby-tools-licenses` file. Make sure to add this file to your `.gitignore` file to keep your license key private.
