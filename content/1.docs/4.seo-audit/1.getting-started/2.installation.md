## Step 1: Install the Plugin

Although it is a commercial plugin, you can download and test it in your local environment before purchasing.

::card{title="Composer" icon="i-ri-terminal-box-line"}
The recommended way to install the plugin:

```bash
composer require johannschopplich/kirby-seo-audit
```

::

::card{title="ZIP File Download" icon="i-ri-folder-zip-line"}
Download the :latest-version or head over to the [releases page](https://github.com/kirby-tools/kirby-seo-audit/releases) to see all versions. Extract the ZIP file to your `site/plugins` folder.

::

## Step 2: Choose Your Workflow

Kirby SEO Audit offers two ways to add SEO analysis to the Panel. Both methods provide the same functionality and can be used together.

::card-group

:::card{title="View Button" icon="i-ri-layout-top-line" to="/docs/seo-audit/configuration/local#view-button-configuration"}

Add an SEO analysis button to the Panel **toolbar** that opens results in a dialog.

```yaml [pages/default.yml]
buttons:
  - seo-audit # Choose position
  - preview
  - settings
  - status
```

:::

:::card{title="Section" icon="i-ri-dashboard-line" to="/docs/seo-audit/configuration/local#section-configuration"}

Alternative display with analysis results inline within the page content.

```yaml
seoAudit:
  type: seo-audit
```

## Step 3: Configure Keyphrase Fields (Optional)

SEO assessments that analyze how the keyphrase is used, such as Introduction Keyword, Meta Description or Keyword Function Words in Keyphrase, will only run with a defined keyphrase. You can define blueprint fields for the keyword and its synonyms to be analyzed with your page. These fields can be used by both the view button and section:

```yaml [pages/default.yml]
# Configure the view button to use keyphrase fields
buttons:
  seo-audit:
    keyphraseField: metakeyphrase
    synonymsField: metasynonyms
  preview: true
  settings: true
  status: true

sections:
  # Define the keyphrase fields
  content:
    type: fields
    fields:
      metaKeyphrase:
        label: SEO Keyphrase
        type: text
        help: The main keyword you want this page to rank for
      metaSynonyms:
        label: Keyphrase Synonyms
        type: tags
        help: Alternative keywords and variations

  # Configure the section to use the same fields
  seoAudit:
    type: seo-audit
    keyphraseField: metakeyphrase
    synonymsField: metasynonyms
```

::callout{icon="i-ri-information-line" color="info" to="/docs/seo-audit/configuration/local"}

## Step 4: Analyze Your Content

Open the Panel and navigate to the page that you want to analyze. You can start the SEO audit in two ways:

- **Using the View Button**: Click the **SEO Audit** button and the analysis results will open in a dialog.
- **Using the Section**: Click the **Analyze** button in the section. The results will be displayed directly in the section.

When using the Panel view button, the analysis results will be displayed in a dialog:

Both methods perform the same analysis process:

1. Fetch the HTML content from your [page's preview URL](/docs/seo-audit/guide/audit-url).
2. Analyze the content using 28 SEO and readability assessments.
3. Present results in four clear categories (Good, OK, Bad, Feedback) with actionable recommendations for improvement.

The analysis considers your defined keyphrase and synonyms to provide targeted optimization suggestions. All analysis runs locally in your browser, ensuring your data remains private and secure.

## Step 5: Buy a License

You can test the plugin locally. However, you need to purchase a license to use the plugin in production environments.

Visit the [product page on Lemon Squeezy](https://byjohann.lemonsqueezy.com/buy/639a814b-ca35-42db-9a40-026fc9274d60) and purchase a license. Then, open any Panel page that contains the SEO Audit view button or section. Click the **Activate** link to open the activation form:

![Kirby SEO Audit activation](/img/kirby-seo-audit-activation.png)

Enter the email you used for the purchase and the order number and hit the submit button. Done! Thanks for supporting our work. Once you activate your license, the license activation buttons will disappear.

::note
Your license key will be stored automatically in `/site/config/.kirby-tools-licenses`. This file is created on first activation. Make sure to add it to your `.gitignore` to keep your license key private.
