This guide covers the changes introduced when upgrading from **Kirby SEO Audit v2 to v3** and how to update your existing configurations.

## Overview of Changes

Kirby SEO Audit v3 brings significant improvements by upgrading the underlying analysis engine from **Yoast SEO v1 to v3**, resulting in better performance, accuracy, and new features. However, some assessment names have changed, and a few assessments have been removed or added.

**All analysis continues to run locally in your browser** - no external web services or API calls are required. The assessments are organized into SEO and readability categories, with results displayed in Good, OK, Bad, and Feedback priority levels.

| Old Name (v2)                   | New Name (v3)          |
| ------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| `ParagraphTooLong`              | `textParagraphTooLong` |
| `OutboundLinks`                 | `externalLinks`        |
| `PageTitleWidth`                | `titleWidth`           |

| `TitleKeyword`                  | `keyphraseInSEOTitle`  |
| `UrlKeyword`                    | `slugKeyword`          |

## Migration Steps

### 1. Update Custom Assessment Lists

If you have custom assessment configurations in your blueprints, update them to use the new names:

**Before (v2):**

```yaml
assessments:
  - PageTitleWidth
  - OutboundLinks
  - KeywordDensity
  - ParagraphTooLong
  - fleschReadingEase # ‚ùå No longer available
```

**After (v3):**

```yaml
assessments:
  - titleWidth
  - externalLinks
  - keyphraseDensity
  - textParagraphTooLong
  - imageKeyphrase # ‚ú® New assessment
```

### 2. Remove Discontinued Assessments

Remove these assessments from your configurations:

- `fleschReadingEase`
- `SentenceLengthInDescription`
- `KeywordStopWords`

### 3. Consider New Assessments

Add the new `imageKeyphrase` assessment to your configurations for improved image SEO:

```yaml
sections:
  seoAudit:
    type: seo-audit
    assessments:
      # Existing assessments
      - titleWidth
      - metaDescriptionLength
      - textLength
      # New v3 assessment
      - imageKeyphrase
```

## Backward Compatibility

The plugin maintains backward compatibility for renamed assessments:

- **Old names still work**: Your existing configurations won't break
- **Automatic mapping**: Old assessment names are automatically converted to new ones
- **Deprecation warnings**: You may see console warnings for old names (in development mode)

## Updated Results Display

The analysis results are now organized into four clear categories, regardless of whether they're SEO or readability assessments:

- **Good** ‚úÖ: Assessments that pass best practices
- **OK** ‚ö†Ô∏è: Areas that could be improved but aren't critical
- **Bad** ‚ùå: Issues that should be addressed for better optimization
- **Feedback** üí°: Suggestions for further improvements

This categorization makes it easier to prioritize optimization efforts compared to the previous flat list format. SEO and readability assessments are mixed together in these categories based on their individual results.
