## Custom Assessment Selection

By default, all assessments are enabled. Pick which SEO and readability assessments to include in the report by adding an `assessments` property to your blueprint, depending on whether you use the view button or section.

::code-group

```yaml [pages/default.yml]
buttons:
  seo-audit:
    # Select the assessments you want to include
    assessments:
      - metaDescriptionKeyword
      - metaDescriptionLength
      - titleWidth
      - images
      - textLength
      - imageKeyphrase
```

```yaml [sections/seo-audit.yml]
type: seo-audit
# Select the assessments you want to include
assessments:
  - metaDescriptionKeyword
  - metaDescriptionLength
  - titleWidth
  - images
  - textLength
  - imageKeyphrase
```

::

::note
Assessment names are case-sensitive and must be written exactly as shown above. The new v3 assessment names should be used for proper functionality.
::

## Keyphrase-Dependent Assessments

The following SEO assessments require a keyphrase to be defined via [`keyphraseField`](/docs/seo-audit/configuration/local#keyphrasefield) or [`keyphrase`](/docs/seo-audit/configuration/local#keyphrase):

- `functionWordsInKeyphrase`
- `introductionKeyword`
- `keyphraseDensity`
- `keyphraseDistribution`
- `keyphraseInSEOTitle`
- `keyphraseLength`
- `metaDescriptionKeyword`
- `slugKeyword`
- `subheadingsKeyword`

If no keyphrase is provided, these assessments will be skipped unless explicitly enabled in the `assessments` property.

## Language-Specific Features

Some assessments are only available in certain languages. The plugin uses the `lang` attribute of the rendered page's HTML for analysis, while the translations of the SEO results are based on the language selected in the Kirby Panel.

::note
Make sure that the language code in your `languages/xx.php` file matches the ISO 639-1 language code (e.g., use `de` for German, not `ger`).
