description: Configure the SEO Audit view button and section in your blueprints with various options.
---

Kirby SEO Audit can be added to Panel views via a **view button** (recommended) or a **section**. Both approaches support the same configuration options and can be used together.

## View Button Configuration

The SEO Audit view button can be added to any Panel view (site, page, file) alongside the default buttons like the preview and settings buttons. It provides instant access to SEO and readability analysis.

Clicking the **SEO Audit** view button immediately runs a SEO and readability analysis for the current page and opens the results in a Panel dialog.

### Basic Setup

To add the `seo-audit` view button to a Panel view, set the `buttons` option in the corresponding blueprint:

```yaml [pages/default.yml]
buttons:
  - seo-audit
  - preview
  - settings
  - status
```

### Advanced Configuration

When configuring the view button in blueprints, use the available properties as props for the `seo-audit` button. For example, to define a field for the keyphrase and limit the assessments to a few selected ones, you can use the following configuration:

```yaml [pages/default.yml]
buttons:
  seo-audit:
    keyphraseField: metakeyphrase
    assessments:
      - metaDescriptionKeyword
      - metaDescriptionLength
      - titleWidth
      - images
      - textLength
    contentSelector: "#main"
  preview: true
  settings: true
  status: true
```

## Shared Properties

### `keyphraseField` :u-badge{label="String" class="align-middle ml-2 rounded-full!" variant="subtle"}

If you want to include keyword/keyphrase assessments in your SEO analysis, you need to define a field in your blueprint that contains the keyphrase for the given page. Alternatively, use the [`keyphrase`](#keyphrase) property (see below). Then, the editor can **enter the keyword or keyphrase for which they want the page to rank in Google.**

Set the `keyphraseField` property to select which field of the current page model contains the keyphrase.

::note
Field references in Kirby are case-insensitive and normalized to lowercase. If your field is named `metaKeyphrase`, reference it as `metakeyphrase` (all lowercase) in the configuration.
::

```yaml [pages/default.yml]
buttons:
  seo-audit:
    # Reference the keyphrase field for the view button
    keyphraseField: metakeyphrase

sections:
  content:
    type: fields
    fields:
      # Define the keyphrase field
      metaKeyphrase:
        label: SEO Keyphrase
        type: text
        help: The main keyword you want this page to rank for
  seoAudit:
    type: seo-audit
    # Reference the keyphrase field for the section
    keyphraseField: metakeyphrase
```

::note
Unless you explicitly include them in the `assessments` property, all keyphrase assessments will be skipped if no `keyphraseField` is defined.
::

### `keyphrase` :u-badge{label="String" class="align-middle ml-2 rounded-full!" variant="subtle"}

If you do not want the editor to enter a keyphrase manually, you can set a default keyphrase for SEO analysis. Alternatively, you can use a **Kirby query** to resolve the keyphrase dynamically.

**When to use which:**

- Use `keyphraseField` when editors should enter their own keyword per page.
- Use `keyphrase` for static keywords or when pulling from a parent page via query.

::note
Kirby queries are only supported when using the SEO Audit section, not the view button.
::

For example, it is useful to automatically use the page title as the keyphrase:

::code-group

```yaml [pages/default.yml]
buttons:
  seo-audit:
    keyphrase: developers
```

```yaml [sections/seo-audit.yml]
type: seo-audit
keyphrase: "{{ page.title.value }}"
```

::

### `synonymsField` :u-badge{label="String" class="align-middle ml-2 rounded-full!" variant="subtle"}

Add synonyms to your keyphrase to avoid repeating the same keyphrase over and over again. Not only will readers like this, but it will also help Google to better understand what your content is about.

Set the `synonymsField` property to indicate which field of the current page model contains the synonyms.

::note
Field references in Kirby are case-insensitive and normalized to lowercase. Use lowercase for field names in the configuration (e.g., `metasynonyms` instead of `metaSynonyms`).
::

```yaml [pages/default.yml]
buttons:
  seo-audit:
    synonymsField: metasynonyms

sections:
  content:
    type: fields
    fields:
      metaKeyphrase:
        label: SEO Keyphrase
        type: text
        help: The main keyword you want this page to rank for
      metaSynonyms:
        label: Keyphrase Synonyms
        type: tags
        help: Alternative keywords and variations
  seoAudit:
    type: seo-audit
    keyphraseField: metakeyphrase
    synonymsField: metasynonyms
```

### `synonyms` :u-badge{label="Array" class="align-middle ml-2 rounded-full!" variant="subtle"}

Similar to the `keyphrase` property, which is as an alternative to the `keyphraseField`, you can set the `synonyms` property directly in the blueprint. This allows you to define synonyms itself, eliminating the need for a separate field that an editor would have to fill in.

::code-group

```yaml [pages/default.yml]
buttons:
  seo-audit:
    keyphrase: SEO Audit
    synonyms:
      - Kirby
      - SEO
      - Audit
```

```yaml [sections/seo-audit.yml]
type: seo-audit
keyphrase: "{{ page.title.value }}"
synonyms:
  - Kirby
  - SEO
  - Audit
```

::

::note
Kirby queries are only supported when using the SEO Audit section, not the view button.
::

### `assessments` :u-badge{label="Array" class="align-middle ml-2 rounded-full!" variant="subtle"}

Kirby SEO Audit comes with a set of assessments used to analyze page content. You can enable or disable individual assessments by setting the `assessments` property. All assessments are enabled by default.

::note
For a list of available SEO checks, see the [Assessments Guide](/docs/seo-audit/guide/assessments) page.
::

Here is an example of a blueprint configuration that only includes a subset of assessments:

::code-group

```yaml [pages/default.yml]
buttons:
  seo-audit:
    assessments:
      # Select the assessments you want to include
      - metaDescriptionKeyword
      - metaDescriptionLength
      - titleWidth
      - images
      - textLength
      - imageKeyphrase
```

```yaml [sections/seo-audit.yml]
type: seo-audit
assessments:
  # Select the assessments you want to include
  - metaDescriptionKeyword
  - metaDescriptionLength
  - titleWidth
  - images
  - textLength
  - imageKeyphrase
```

::

### `contentSelector` :u-badge{label="String" class="align-middle ml-2 rounded-full!" variant="subtle"}

The `contentSelector` property lets you define a CSS selector that specifies which part of the page should be analyzed. Use this to exclude navigation, footers, or sidebars from analysis – this prevents the plugin from flagging repetitive content that appears on every page.

By default, the plugin uses the `body` tag to select the content of the page. To analyze only the content of a specific element, set the `contentSelector` property:

::code-group

```yaml [pages/default.yml]
buttons:
  seo-audit:
    contentSelector: "#main:not(.sidebar):not(.footer)"
```

```yaml [sections/seo-audit.yml]
type: seo-audit
contentSelector: "#main:not(.sidebar):not(.footer)"
```

::

::note
The `contentSelector` also supports querying for multiple elements. For instance, to select all elements with the class `.seo-audit-allowed` while excluding elements certain elements with the class `.seo-audit-ignore`, you can use the following selector: `.seo-audit-allowed > *:not(.seo-audit-ignore)`.
::

To debug the content used for the SEO analysis, you can set the log level to `info` or higher. This will log the extracted HTML to the console:

::code-group

```yaml [pages/default.yml]
buttons:
  seo-audit:
    contentSelector: ".seo-audit-allowed > *:not(.seo-audit-ignore)"
    logLevel: info
```

```yaml [sections/seo-audit.yml]
type: seo-audit
contentSelector: ".seo-audit-allowed > *:not(.seo-audit-ignore)"
logLevel: info
```

::

### `links` :u-badge{label="Boolean" class="align-middle ml-2 rounded-full!" variant="subtle"}

The analysis results contain links to recommendation articles on [Yoast.com](https://yoast.com) that explain the individual assessments in more detail. While these links may be helpful, you may want to disable them for privacy reasons or to avoid distracting the editor.

To disable any links in the SEO report, set the `links` property to `false`:

::code-group

```yaml [pages/default.yml]
buttons:
  seo-audit:
    links: false
```

```yaml [sections/seo-audit.yml]
type: seo-audit
links: false
```

::

### `logLevel` :u-badge{label="String" class="align-middle ml-2 rounded-full!" variant="subtle"}

Set the log level for debugging purposes. This property controls how much information is logged to the browser console during the analysis process.

The available log levels are: `error`, `warn`, `info`, `debug`

::code-group

```yaml [pages/default.yml]
buttons:
  seo-audit:
    logLevel: info
```

```yaml [sections/seo-audit.yml]
type: seo-audit
logLevel: info
```

::

## Section Configuration

As an alternative to the view button, you can add a SEO Audit section to your blueprint. The section displays analysis results directly within the page content area instead of in a dialog.

### Basic Setup

To add the SEO Audit section to a blueprint, include the following configuration:

```yaml [pages/default.yml]
sections:
  seoAudit:
    type: seo-audit
```

This is how the section will render in the Panel:

::preview{src="/img/kirby-seo-audit-section.png" alt="SEO audit section in Kirby Panel" width="1074" height="186"}
::

Click the **Analyze** button to perform a **SEO and readability analysis** on the current page. The analysis results are organized into three categories: Good, OK, and Bad, making it easy to prioritize optimization efforts:

::preview{src="/img/kirby-seo-audit-section-result.png" alt="SEO audit section showing categorized results" width="1074" height="1515"}
::

### Section-Only Properties

### `label` :u-badge{label="String" class="align-middle ml-2 rounded-full!" variant="subtle"}

The plugin provides a section label based on the current Panel language. However, you can customize the label by setting the `label` property.

To change the label, set the `label` property to your desired text:

```yaml [sections/seo-audit.yml]
type: seo-audit
label: SEO Report
```

### `persisted` :u-badge{label="Boolean" class="align-middle ml-2 rounded-full!" variant="subtle"}

By default, SEO reports are saved to the browser's local storage. This allows editors to close the Panel and return later without rerunning the analysis. It is also useful for comparing "before" and "after" results when optimizing content.

To disable saving the analysis, set the `persisted` property to `false`:

```yaml [sections/seo-audit.yml]
type: seo-audit
persisted: false
```
