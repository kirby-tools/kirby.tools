The Kirby SEO Audit plugin provides comprehensive SEO analysis directly within the Kirby Panel. It helps you, your clients, and editors optimize content for search engines with real-time analysis and actionable recommendations. Built on the Yoast SEO v3 engine, the plugin lets you improve your website's SEO the way millions of Yoast WordPress users do.

## How It Works

There are two ways to run SEO audits in your Kirby Panel:

- **View Button** :u-badge{label="Recommended" color="primary" size="sm" class="align-text-bottom"}:
  Add a single line to your blueprint and get an SEO Audit button in your page header. Click it, and the analysis results appear in a dialog.
- **Section**:
  Add a section to your blueprints for inline audit results. Click the "Analyze" button in the section to run the analysis.

Both methods use the same analysis engine and support the same configuration properties.

## Analysis Categories

Kirby SEO Audit organizes assessment results into three clear categories to help you prioritize optimization efforts:

| ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- | ----------------- |

| **OK**       | ⚠️ Areas that could be improved but are not critical | Orange indicators |
| **Bad**      | ❌ Issues that should be addressed for better SEO    | Red indicators    |

## Assessment Engine

Kirby SEO Audit analyzes your content using two categories of assessments:

- **SEO Assessments**: Assessments covering keyword optimization, meta data, links, and technical SEO
- **Readability Assessments**: Assessments focusing on content structure, sentence length, and readability

All assessments run locally in your browser using the Yoast SEO v3 engine – no external web services or API calls are made. Results are organized into Good, OK, Bad, and Feedback categories regardless of their SEO or readability classification.
