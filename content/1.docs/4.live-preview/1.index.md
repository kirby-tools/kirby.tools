## Step 1: Install the Plugin

Although it is a commercial plugin, you can download and test it in your local environment before purchasing.

The recommended way to install the plugin:

```bash
composer require johannschopplich/kirby-live-preview
```

::

::card{title="ZIP File Download" icon="i-ri-folder-zip-line"}
Download the :latest-version or head over to the [releases page](https://github.com/kirby-tools/kirby-live-preview/releases) to see all versions. Extract the ZIP file to your `site/plugins` folder.

## Step 2: Blueprint Setup

Select a site or page blueprint to which you want to add the Live Preview section. Add the following section configuration to the blueprint file:

```yaml [pages/default.yml]
sections:
  livePreview:
    type: preview
```

Now, open the Panel and navigate to a page that uses the blueprint. You should see a new section called **Live Preview** with a list of clickable buttons:

::preview{src="/img/kirby-live-preview-buttons.png" alt="Kirby Live Preview buttons" width="1026" height="78"}
::

## Step 3: Customize the Live Preview

Fit the Live Preview section to your blueprint layout and customize it as needed. It can be part of any column and can be sticky. The latter is useful for previewing content changes side-by-side with blocks or other fields:

```yaml [pages/default.yml]
columns:
  - width: 2/3
    fields:
      blocks:
        type: blocks

  - width: 1/3
    # Make the preview sticky
    sticky: true
    sections:
      livePreview:
        type: preview
```

Now you see a rendering of the page content. It updates as you type:

![Kirby Live Preview panel example](/img/kirby-live-preview-panel-example.png)

Try navigating through the preview – if you click on a site link, such as in the header, the corresponding Panel page will open instead of the link in the preview.

For more configuration properties, see the [Configuration](/docs/live-preview/configuration) guide.

## Step 4: Buy a License

You can test the plugin locally. However, you need to purchase a license to use the plugin in production environments.

Visit the [product page on Lemon Squeezy](https://byjohann.lemonsqueezy.com/buy/359409ce-840d-48c4-aca3-e7d79a95f6d4) and purchase a license. The easiest way to activate your license is to go to the system view in the Kirby Panel and click on **Activate now**:

![Kirby Panel system area with the license activation form](/img/kirby-system-area-plugin-activation.png)

Enter the email you used for the purchase and the order number and hit the submit button. Done! Thanks for supporting our work. Once you activate your license, the license activation buttons will disappear.

::note
Your license key will be stored automatically in `/site/config/.kirby-tools-licenses`. This file is created on first activation. Make sure to add it to your `.gitignore` to keep your license key private.

## Troubleshooting

### Live Preview in Safari

Due to security restrictions, Safari requires additional configuration to allow the Live Preview iframe to communicate with the Panel. To ensure the Live Preview works in Safari, add the following configuration to your `config.php`:

```php [config.php]
return [
    'panel' => [
        'frameAncestors' => ['self']
    ]
];
```
