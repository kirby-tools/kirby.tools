description: Learn how the default system prompt works and when to customize it.

While the user prompt instructs the AI model _what_ to generate, the system prompt instructs the AI model _how_ to generate content. It provides structural guidance for the generation process.

## Default System Prompt

Kirby Copilot ships with a well-crafted system prompt that handles most use cases out of the box. Manual customization is rarely necessary.

The default prompt automatically adapts to:

- The **target field type** (plain text, Markdown, or rich-text)
- **Selected text** in writer or textarea fields (preserved as context)
- **Attached files** like PDFs (text is extracted when files exceed 50 MB)

```txt
You are a content assistant.

When <response_format> is provided, format your response as:
- "text": Plain text only, no formatting syntax.
- "markdown": Raw Markdown, no code fence wrappers.
- "rich-text": Use double newlines to separate paragraphs. For inline formatting, use HTML tags (<strong>, <em>, <code>, <a href="...">, etc.). Do NOT wrap paragraphs in <p> tags.

When <selection> is provided, use it as context for your response. Preserve any formatting (bold, italic, links, etc.) present in the selection unless the task explicitly requires different formatting.
```

## Response Formats

The response format is determined automatically based on how you trigger AI generation:

| Trigger                    | Response Format | Description                                                                                |
| -------------------------- | --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `textarea` toolbar button  | `markdown`      | Raw Markdown without code fences                                                           |
| `writer` toolbar mark      | `text`          | Plain text only                                                                            |
| `blocks` / `layout` fields | –               | [Schema-based generation](/docs/copilot/advanced/blocks-and-layouts) (no format directive) |

::note
For blocks and layout fields, Copilot uses schema-based object generation, which supports all custom block types defined in your project.

## Customizing the System Prompt

In most cases, the default system prompt is sufficient. To override it globally:

```php [config.php]
return [
    'johannschopplich.copilot' => [
        'systemPrompt' => 'Your custom system prompt here…'
    ]
];
```

You can also override the system prompt per blueprint in [view button](/docs/copilot/configuration/local#systemprompt) configurations.

## Auto-Completion Prompt

The [auto-completion feature](/docs/copilot/usage/auto-completion) uses a separate, lightweight system prompt optimized for inline text suggestions. This prompt cannot be customized:

```txt
You are a writing assistant providing inline autocompletions.

RULES:
- Output ONLY the continuation text, NEVER repeat input
- Keep completions brief (1-2 sentences max)
- Match the existing tone and style
- No explanations or meta-commentary

FORMAT:
- If given <prefix> and <suffix> tags, insert text that bridges them naturally
- Otherwise, continue the text directly

EXAMPLE:
Input: "The quick brown fox"
Output: " jumps over the lazy dog."
```
