title: Fields as Context
description: Use fields as placeholders in user prompts.

Context is key to effective prompting. By providing relevant information about the content you want to generate, you can guide the AI model to produce more accurate and useful results. Kirby Copilot makes it easy to include field values from the same Kirby model as context in user prompts.

## Placeholders in User Prompts

Kirby Copilot provides all fields from the same Kirby model as placeholders in user prompts. This allows you to include additional information in the prompt. To use a field name as a placeholder, wrap it in curly braces: `{field}`. Placeholders are replaced with the actual field values when the user submits the prompt.

::note
If the field value is not a primitive (e.g. a string, number, or boolean), it will be encoded as JSON before being used as a placeholder. AI models are pretty good at understanding structured data, such as JSON.

Before the user prompt above is sent to the AI model, the placeholder `{content}` is replaced with the actual field value of the main content.

::tip
Whether you use the Copilot Panel view button, the toolbar buttons or the Copilot section, the placeholders are available in every user prompt.

Instead of typing placeholders manually, you can use the **Insert field placeholder** button in the prompt dialog toolbar next to the attachment icon. Click the button to open a dropdown menu that lists all available fields from the current Kirby model. Selecting a field inserts the placeholder at the current cursor position in the prompt textarea.

## Examples

One common use case is generating text for a specific field, such as a meta description from a page's title and main content. For instance, if your Kirby model has a `content` field, you can create a user prompt that references this field to generate a meta description:

```
Write an engaging SEO meta description for the article "{title}". Limit it to 140 characters.

This is my article:
{content}
```

### With Panel View Button

The Copilot Panel view button is the easiest way to generate text for a specific field. Click on the Copilot button in the Panel view header to open the prompt dialog. The user can then select the meta description field from the dropdown menu and enter the prompt above:

### With Writer/Textarea Button

If the meta description field is a `writer` or `textarea` field, you can also use the [Copilot toolbar button](/docs/copilot/usage/toolbar-buttons) in the field toolbar for quick access to the Copilot prompt dialog.

Suppose your page contains a `blocks` or `writer` field with the main content and a `textarea` field for the meta description:

```yaml [pages/default.yml]
fields:
  content:
    label: Content
    type: writer

  metaDescription:
    label: Meta Description
    type: textarea
    buttons:
      # Only allow the copilot button for this field
      - copilot
```

In this blueprint example, the only visible button for the `textarea` field is the Copilot toolbar button. This will suggest the user to use Kirby Copilot for meta description generation:

::preview{src="/img/copilot-example-seo-description-field.png" alt="Copilot button in textarea field for SEO description" width="1074" height="378"}
::

When the user clicks the Copilot button, the prompt dialog opens. The user can then enter the above prompt, and the placeholder `{content}` will be replaced with the actual content of the writer field when the prompt is sent to the AI model.

### With Copilot Section

Placeholders are also available in the [Copilot Panel section](/docs/copilot/configuration/local). You can set up a Copilot section for the meta description field with a [predefined user prompt](/docs/copilot/examples/section-blueprints#predefined-user-prompt) for a smooth workflow.

An example section configuration for a meta description field could look like this:

```yaml
sections:
  copilot:
    type: copilot
    field: metaDescription
    userPrompt: |
      Generate a SEO meta description in 140 characters max for my article "{title}":
      {text}
```
