The Kirby Copilot plugin lets you select files to enrich the user prompt with additional information. For example, you can select product images and ask the AI to describe the product visually or select PDF files and let the AI use these documents to provide better results.

## Analyzing Images

In order to pass images as input to the AI, you need a model that supports image processing. Currently, the following models support image input:

- Most OpenAI's GPT models
- OpenAI's advanced reasoning models
- Anthropic's Claude models
- Google's Gemini models

Unlike the user prompt, images are not written to local storage. Thus, a Panel refresh will remove all selected images.

::warning
If you configure the Copilot plugin to use a different AI provider that does not support image processing, such as Mistral AI's Mixtral models, the images will be ignored.

### Image Resizing

When the Panel user selects files, the plugin will automatically downscale all images to a maximum size of `2048px`. On the one hand, this ensures that the AI can process the images quickly, and on the other hand, it complies with the OpenAI image size limit of fitting into a 2048 pixel bounding box.

Image resizing happens on the fly, directly in the browser, before the image is sent to the AI provider.

### Panel File as Context Source

On a Kirby file page, you can set the value to `auto` to pre-select the **current file as context** for the user prompt. This is useful if you want to generate text for a specific file, such as an image or PDF, that has already been uploaded to the Panel:

```yaml [sections/copilot.yml]
type: copilot
field: alt
# Use the uploaded file as context
files: auto
# Optional: Provide a pre-defined user prompt
userPrompt: Write an alternative text for the provided image. Use a maximum of 10 words.
# Optional: Disable the editing of the user prompt
editable: false
```

The section above will use the current file of a Kirby file model as context for the user prompt:

:prose-video{src="/vid/kirby-copilot-generate-image-alt.mp4" poster="/vid/kirby-copilot-generate-image-alt-poster.jpg" width="908" height="540"}

## Processing PDF Files

PDF files can be used to support user prompts with information that the AI can incorporate to generate answers. For example, you can select a PDF with a product description and ask the AI to summarize the product.

:prose-video{src="/vid/kirby-copilot-pdf-files.mp4" poster="/vid/kirby-copilot-pdf-files-poster.jpg" width="908" height="540"}

### Native PDF Parsing

When selecting PDF files with the [Select files](/docs/copilot/configuration/local#files) button, the plugin uses **native PDF parsing** by default. Modern AI models like OpenAI's latest models and Google Gemini support reading PDF files directly, which provides the most accurate results.

The PDF file is sent directly to the AI provider along with your prompt, allowing the model to understand the document's structure, formatting, and content natively.

### Fallback to Text Extraction

For PDF files **larger than 50 MB**, the plugin automatically falls back to text extraction. This extraction process happens directly in the browser with [Mozilla's PDF.js](https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js) library and does not require any server-side processing.

When using text extraction, the extracted text is added to your user prompt before being sent to the AI provider.

For example, if this is your user prompt:

```txt
Summarize the product in 200 words.
```

Then, each PDF file will be added to the prompt, resulting in the final prompt:

```txt
Summarize the product in 200 words.

<pdf_document_1>
(Extracted text from PDF document 1)
</pdf_document_1>

<pdf_document_2>
(Extracted text from PDF document 2)
</pdf_document_2>
```
