## Fields as Placeholders in User Prompts

Context is key to a good user prompt. The more context you can provide, the better the AI can understand the user's intent.

Kirby Copilot provides all fields from the same Kirby model as placeholders in user prompts. This allows you to include additional information in the prompt. Wrap the field name in curly braces to use it as a placeholder: `{field}`.

For example, suppose your page contains a `writer` field with the main content and a `textarea` field for the meta description:

```yaml [pages/default.yml]
fields:
  content:
    label: Content
    type: writer

  metaDescription:
    label: Meta Description
    type: textarea
    buttons:
      # Only allow the copilot button for this field
      - copilot
```

In the example above, the only allowed button for the `textarea` field is the Copilot prompt dialog:

::preview{src="/img/copilot-example-seo-description-field.png"}
::

When the user clicks the Copilot button, the value of the `content` field can be used as a placeholder in the user prompt to generate a better meta description. The user prompt could look like this:

![Kirby Copilot textarea prompt dialog](/img/copilot-example-seo-description-prompt.png)

Before the user prompt above is sent to the AI model, the placeholder `{content}` is replaced with the actual field value of the main content.

::callout{icon="i-ri-information-line"}
Placeholders are also available in the [Copilot Panel section](/docs/configuration/section). You could set up a Copilot section for the meta description field with a [predefined user prompt](/docs/examples/section-blueprints#predefined-user-prompt) for a smooth workflow.

## Encoding Field Values

If the field value is not a primitive (e.g. a string, number, or boolean), it will be encoded as JSON before being used as a placeholder. AI models are pretty good at understanding structured data like JSON.
