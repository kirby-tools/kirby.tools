description: AI-powered inline text suggestions for writer fields.
---

Writer fields support AI-powered auto-completion that suggests text as you type. This feature is **enabled by default** for all writer fields – no configuration required.

Auto-completion and the toolbar button complement each other: use inline suggestions for quick writing flow, and the toolbar button for generating or editing larger text blocks via the prompt dialog.

::card-group

::card{title="Copilot Toolbar Button" icon="i-ri-sparkling-line"}

Opens the Copilot prompt dialog to generate or edit text.

- Visible in toolbar
- Opens prompt dialog
- Works with selected text

::

::card{title="Auto-Completion" icon="i-ri-magic-line"}

**Inline suggestions** appear as ghost text while you type.

- Enabled by default
- Automatic suggestions
- Tab to accept

## How It Works

After a brief pause in typing (1 second by default), Copilot analyzes your current text and suggests a completion. The suggestion appears as ghost text in a subtle gray color after your cursor. Press :kbd{value="tab"} (Tab) to accept it, :kbd{value="escape"} to dismiss it – or just keep typing.

## Keyboard Shortcuts

| Action             | Shortcut                                                                                        |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Accept suggestion  | :kbd{value="tab"} (Tab)                                                                         |
| Dismiss suggestion | :kbd{value="escape"}                                                                            |
| Trigger manually   | :kbd{value="meta"} :kbd{value=","} (macOS) / :kbd{value="CTRL"} :kbd{value=","} (Windows/Linux) |

::tip
By default, auto-completion only triggers at the **end of a text node** – after a pause in typing. Use the manual trigger (:kbd{value="meta"} :kbd{value=","} / :kbd{value="CTRL"} :kbd{value=","}) to request a suggestion **between words** or in the middle of a sentence.

## Completion Model

Auto-completion uses a dedicated lightweight model optimized for speed. Configure the `completionModel` per provider in your [global configuration](/docs/copilot/configuration/global#default-models):

```php [config.php]
return [
    'johannschopplich.copilot' => [
        'provider' => 'google',
        'providers' => [
            'google' => [
                'apiKey' => env('GOOGLE_API_KEY'),
                'model' => 'gemini-3-pro-preview',
                 // Fast model for completions
                'completionModel' => 'gemini-3-flash-preview'
            ]
        ]
    ]
];
```

## Disabling Auto-Completion

To disable auto-completion globally for all writer fields:

```php [config.php]
return [
    'johannschopplich.copilot' => [
        'completion' => false
    ]
];
```

## Customizing Debounce Timing

The debounce controls how long Copilot waits after you stop typing before suggesting a completion. The default is 1000ms (1 second). You can customize this:

```php [config.php]
return [
    'johannschopplich.copilot' => [
        'completion' => [
            'debounce' => 1500 // Wait 1.5 seconds
        ]
    ]
];
```

::note
The minimum debounce is 500ms to prevent excessive API calls.
