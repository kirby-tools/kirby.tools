Kirby Copilot v2.5.0 introduces a new **Panel view button** that allows you to open the prompt dialog from anywhere in the Panel. This is particularly useful if you want to generate content for **multiple fields at once**.

## Setting Up the View Button

To add the `copilot` button to a particular view, set the `buttons` option in the corresponding blueprint. The following example shows how to reference the default buttons and add the `copilot` button to the `site`, `pages`, and `files` views:

::code-group

```yaml [site.yml]
buttons:
  - copilot # Re-order the button as needed
  - preview
  - languages
```

```yaml [pages/default.yml]
buttons:
  - copilot # Re-order the button as needed
  - preview
  - settings
  - languages
  - status
```

```yaml [files/default.yml]
buttons:
  - copilot # Re-order the button as needed
  - preview
  - settings
  - languages
```

::

This way, you can reference the default buttons and decide where to place the `copilot` button. It will look something like this:

::preview{src="/img/kirby-copilot-view-button.png" alt="Copilot Panel view button"}
::

## Using the View Button

Clicking the button opens the Copilot prompt dialog, which allows you to generate content for the fields in the current view. You can select multiple fields at once, which makes it easier to generate content for multiple fields in one go.

## Prompt History

The prompt history is saved in the browser's local storage. You can access the prompt history with the keyboard arrow keys when the prompt dialog is open.

Use the up `↑` key to navigate to the previous prompt and the down `↓` key to navigate to the next prompt.
