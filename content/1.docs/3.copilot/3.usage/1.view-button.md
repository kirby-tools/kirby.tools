description: Add the Copilot button to the Panel view for easy access to the prompt dialog.

Kirby Copilot v2.5.0 introduces a new **Panel view button** that allows you to open the prompt dialog from anywhere in the Panel. This is particularly useful if you want to generate content for **multiple fields at once**.

To add the `copilot` button to a particular view, set the `buttons` option in the corresponding blueprint. The following example shows how to reference the default buttons and add the `copilot` button to the `site`, `pages`, and `files` views:

::code-group

```yaml [site.yml]
buttons:
  - copilot # Re-order the button as needed
  - preview
  - languages
```

```yaml [pages/default.yml]
buttons:
  - copilot # Re-order the button as needed
  - preview
  - settings
  - languages
  - status
```

```yaml [files/default.yml]
buttons:
  - copilot # Re-order the button as needed
  - preview
  - settings
  - languages
```

::

This way, you can reference the default buttons and decide where to place the `copilot` button. It will look something like this:

::preview{src="/img/kirby-copilot-view-button.png" alt="Copilot Panel view button"}
::

Clicking the button opens the Copilot prompt dialog, which allows you to generate content for the fields in the current view. You can select multiple fields at once, which makes it easier to fill out forms or create consistent content across different sections.
