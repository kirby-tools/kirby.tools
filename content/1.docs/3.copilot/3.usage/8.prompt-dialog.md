The prompt dialog is the central interface for interacting with AI models in Kirby Copilot. It is used by both the [view button](/docs/copilot/usage/view-button) for multi-field generation and the [toolbar buttons](/docs/copilot/usage/toolbar-buttons) for inline text generation.

## Prompt Templates :u-badge{label="since v3.0.0" class="align-middle mb-1 ml-2 rounded-full" variant="subtle"}

Save frequently used prompts as templates for quick access. Five built-in templates are included:

- **Fix Grammar**: Correct grammar and spelling errors
- **Make Concise**: Shorten text while preserving meaning
- **Simplify**: Rewrite in simpler language
- **Extend**: Expand on the existing content
- **Summarize**: Create a brief summary

### Managing Templates

1. Click the bookmark icon in the prompt dialog
2. Select "Save as template" to save the current prompt
3. Access saved templates from the dropdown menu
4. Edit or delete templates via the template manager

Templates are saved per user in the browser's local storage.

## Prompt History

Your prompts are saved in the browser's local storage (up to 50 entries per site). Access recent prompts via the history dropdown or navigate with arrow keys in the prompt textarea.
