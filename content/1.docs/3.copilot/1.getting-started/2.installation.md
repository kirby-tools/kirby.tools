## Step 1: Install the Plugin

Although it is a commercial plugin, you can download and test it in your local environment before purchasing.

::card{title="Composer" icon="i-ri-terminal-box-line"}
The recommended way to install the plugin:

```bash
composer require johannschopplich/kirby-copilot
```

::

::card{title="ZIP File Download" icon="i-ri-folder-zip-line"}
Download the :latest-version or head over to the [releases page](https://github.com/kirby-tools/kirby-copilot/releases) to see all versions. Extract the ZIP file to your `site/plugins` folder.

## Step 2: AI Provider Configuration

Configure the AI provider by setting the **API key** in the global Kirby configuration. The AI model is optional – [sensible defaults](/docs/copilot/advanced/reference#default-ai-models) are provided for each provider.

For example, to get started with Google Gemini, create a new [Google API key](https://aistudio.google.com/api-keys) and add it to the configuration:

```php [config.php]
return [
    'johannschopplich.copilot' => [
        'provider' => 'google',
        'providers' => [
            'google' => [
                'model' => 'gemini-3-pro-preview',
                'apiKey' => 'YOUR_API_KEY'
            ]
        ]
    ]
];
```

::warning
We recommend to create a unique API key for each project. This way, you can easily revoke access to the API key if needed.

## Step 3: Choose Your Workflow

Kirby Copilot offers four ways to generate content. Each method integrates seamlessly into the Panel and can be mixed and matched based on your needs.

If you are unsure where to start, we recommend adding the `copilot` **view button** to your blueprint first.

::card-group

:::card{title="View Button" icon="i-ri-layout-top-line" to="/docs/copilot/usage/view-button"}

Generate content for a single **multiple fields at once** from any Panel view.

::::code-group

```yaml [site.yml]
buttons:
  - copilot # Choose position
  - preview
  - languages
```

```yaml [page.yml]
buttons:
  - copilot # Choose position
  - preview
  - settings
  - languages
  - status
```

```yaml [file.yml]
buttons:
  - copilot # Choose position
  - preview
  - settings
  - languages
```

::::

:::

:::card{title="Toolbar Buttons" icon="i-ri-edit-line" to="/docs/copilot/usage/toolbar-buttons"}

In-context editing for **writer** and **textarea** fields with selected text support.

::::code-group

```yaml [Writer Field]
text:
  type: writer
  marks:
    - copilot
```

```yaml [Textarea Field]
text:
  type: textarea
  buttons:
    - copilot
```

::::

:::

:::card{title="Auto-Completion" icon="i-ri-magic-line" to="/docs/copilot/usage/auto-completion"}
Ghost text suggestions as you type in **writer** fields. Enabled by default.
:::

:::card{title="Copilot Section" icon="i-ri-dashboard-line" to="/docs/copilot/usage/section"}
Dedicated blueprint section for field-specific generation workflows.

```yaml
copilotSection:
  type: copilot
  field: blocks
```

## Step 4: Buy a License

You can test the plugin locally. However, you need to purchase a license to use the plugin in production environments.

Visit the [product page on Lemon Squeezy](https://byjohann.lemonsqueezy.com/buy/ce8a5fd2-8a01-4972-9a5d-e9dbbca17acf) and purchase a license. Then, open any Panel page that contains the Copilot view button or section. You will see a license activation notice. Click the **Activate** link to open the activation form:

![Kirby Copilot activation](/img/kirby-copilot-activation.png)

Enter the email you used for the purchase and the order number and hit the submit button. Done! Thanks for supporting our work. Once you activate your license, the license activation buttons will disappear.

::note
Your license key will be stored automatically in `/site/config/.kirby-tools-licenses`. This file is created on first activation. Make sure to add it to your `.gitignore` to keep your license key private.
