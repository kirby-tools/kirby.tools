## Step 1: Install the Plugin

Although it is a commercial plugin, you can download and test the plugin in your local environment before purchasing it.

### Composer

The recommended way to install the plugin is via Composer. To install the plugin, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
composer require johannschopplich/kirby-copilot
```

### Download

Head over to the [releases page](https://github.com/kirby-tools/kirby-copilot/releases) and download the latest version of the plugin as a ZIP file. Extract the contents of this ZIP file to your `site/plugins` folder. It should look like this:

```
site/plugins/
├─ kirby-copilot/
│  └─ … All plugin files
```

## Step 2: AI Provider Configuration

Configure the AI provider by setting the **API key** and **AI model** in the global Kirby configuration. Each provider has its own configuration key. To get started with OpenAI, create a new [OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) and add it to the configuration along with the AI model such as o3-mini:

```php [config.php]
return [
    'johannschopplich.copilot' => [
        'providers' => [
            'openai' => [
                'model' => 'o3-mini',
                'apiKey' => 'YOUR_API_KEY'
            ]
        ]
    ]
];
```

We recommend to create a unique API key for each project. This way, you can easily revoke access to the API key if needed.
::

## Step 3: Usage

### Writer & Textarea Toolbar Button

Kirby Copilot provides a dedicated button for the Kirby `writer` and `textarea` fields. Open the prompt dialog with the keyboard shortcuts `Cmd + .` (macOS) or `Ctrl + .` (Windows/Linux) or by clicking the Copilot button in the toolbar. The selected text (if any) will be appended to the user prompt before sending it to the AI model.

::callout{icon="i-ri-lightbulb-line" to="/docs/usage/toolbar-buttons"}
Follow the toolbar buttons guide for more information.
::

To enable the button, add the `copilot` button to the toolbar configuration:

```yaml [pages/default.yml]
fields:
  # For writer fields
  text01:
    label: Text
    type: writer
    marks:
      - copilot

  # For textarea fields
  text02:
    label: Text
    type: textarea
    buttons:
      - copilot
```

### Section Blueprint

To display the Copilot section in the Kirby Panel, add a section of type `copilot` to your blueprint:

```yaml [pages/default.yml]
sections:
  copilot:
    type: copilot
    field: blocks
```

The only required section property is `field`. This is the target field of the Kirby model that will be used to write the generated text to.

After adding the section, you can start using the plugin in the Kirby Panel. The accordion will be closed by default:

::preview{src="/img/copilot-section-closed.png"}
::

Click on the arrow to open the accordion and start entering your prompt:

::preview{src="/img/copilot-section-open.png"}
::

## Step 4: Buy a License

You can test the plugin locally. However, you need to purchase a license to use the plugin in production environments.

Visit the [product page on Lemon Squeezy](https://byjohann.lemonsqueezy.com/buy/ce8a5fd2-8a01-4972-9a5d-e9dbbca17acf) and purchase a license. Then, open any Panel page that contains the SEO Audit section. Click the **Activate** link to open the activation form:

![Kirby Copilot activation](/img/kirby-copilot-activation.png)

Enter the email you used for the purchase and the order number and hit the submit button. Done! Thanks for supporting our work. Once you activate your license, the license activation buttons will disappear.

::callout{icon="i-ri-information-line"}
Your license key will be automatically stored in the `/site/config/.kirby-tools-licenses` file. Make sure to add this file to your `.gitignore` file to keep your license key private.
