## Step 1: Install the Plugin

Although it is a commercial plugin, you can download and test the plugin in your local environment before purchasing it.

### Composer

The recommended way to install the plugin is via Composer. To install the plugin, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
composer require johannschopplich/kirby-copilot
```

### Download

Head over to the [releases page](https://github.com/kirby-tools/kirby-copilot/releases) and download the latest version of the plugin as a ZIP file. Extract the contents of this ZIP file to your `site/plugins` folder. It should look like this:

```
site/plugins/
â”œâ”€ kirby-copilot/
â”‚  â””â”€ â€¦ All plugin files
```

## Step 2: AI Provider Configuration

Configure the AI provider by setting the **API key** and **AI model** in the global Kirby configuration. Each provider has its own configuration option. To get started with Google, create a new [Google Gemini API key](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api) and add it to the configuration along with the AI model such as Gemini 2.5 Flash:

```php [config.php]
return [
    'johannschopplich.copilot' => [
        'provider' => 'google',
        'providers' => [
            'openai' => [
                'model' => 'gemini-2.5-flash',
                'apiKey' => 'YOUR_API_KEY'
            ]
        ]
    ]
];
```

::warning
We recommend to create a unique API key for each project. This way, you can easily revoke access to the API key if needed.
::

## Step 3: Usage

There is not only one, but three ways to use the Kirby Copilot plugin in the Panel:

- **Panel View Button**: Useful to generate multiple fields with a single prompt. Access the prompt dialog from anywhere in the Panel.
- **Writer & Textarea Toolbar Button**: Use the Copilot button in the toolbar of `writer` and `textarea` fields to generate content based on the selected text or the entire content of the field.
- **Copilot Section**: Add a dedicated section to your blueprint to generate content for a _specific field_.

### Panel View Button

Kirby 5 introduces new extensions that allow you to add custom view buttons to most Panel views (e.g. page, site, or file). The Copilot plugin provides a prompt button that can be added alongside the default buttons:

::preview{src="/img/kirby-copilot-view-button.png" alt="Copilot Panel view button"}
::

To add the `copilot` button to a particular view, set the `buttons` option in the corresponding blueprint. The following example shows how to reference the default buttons and add the `copilot` button to the `site`, `pages`, and `files` views:

::code-group

```yaml [site.yml]
buttons:
  - copilot # Re-order the button as needed
  - preview
  - languages
```

```yaml [pages/default.yml]
buttons:
  - copilot # Re-order the button as needed
  - preview
  - settings
  - languages
  - status
```

```yaml [files/default.yml]
buttons:
  - copilot # Re-order the button as needed
  - preview
  - settings
  - languages
```

::

This allows you to reference the default buttons and decide where to place the `copilot` button. When clicking it, the prompt dialog will open, allowing you to write instructions for the AI model and select the fields for which you want to generate content:

::note
Kirby 4 does not support custom view buttons, but the `copilot` button has been backported ðŸŽ‰. It is always prepended to all other Panel header buttons.
::

### Writer & Textarea Toolbar Button

Kirby Copilot provides a dedicated button for the Kirby `writer` and `textarea` fields. Open the prompt dialog with the keyboard shortcuts `Cmd + .` (macOS) or `Ctrl + .` (Windows/Linux) or by clicking the Copilot button in the toolbar. The selected text (if any) will be appended to the user prompt before sending it to the AI model.

::callout{icon="i-ri-lightbulb-line" color="info" to="/docs/copilot/usage/toolbar-buttons"}
Follow the toolbar buttons guide for more information.
::

To enable the button, add the `copilot` button to the toolbar configuration:

```yaml [pages/default.yml]
fields:
  # For writer fields
  text01:
    label: Text
    type: writer
    marks:
      - copilot

  # For textarea fields
  text02:
    label: Text
    type: textarea
    buttons:
      - copilot
```

### Section Blueprint

To display the Copilot section in the Kirby Panel, add a section of type `copilot` to your blueprint:

```yaml [pages/default.yml]
sections:
  copilot:
    type: copilot
    field: blocks
```

The only required section property is `field`. This is the target field of the Kirby model that will be used to write the generated text to.

After adding the section, you can start using the plugin in the Kirby Panel. The accordion will be closed by default:

::preview{src="/img/copilot-section-closed.png" alt="Copilot section in closed state"}
::

Click on the arrow to open the accordion and start entering your prompt:

::preview{src="/img/copilot-section-open.png" alt="Copilot section in open state"}
::

## Step 4: Buy a License

You can test the plugin locally. However, you need to purchase a license to use the plugin in production environments.

Visit the [product page on Lemon Squeezy](https://byjohann.lemonsqueezy.com/buy/ce8a5fd2-8a01-4972-9a5d-e9dbbca17acf) and purchase a license. Then, open any Panel page that contains the SEO Audit section. Click the **Activate** link to open the activation form:

![Kirby Copilot activation](/img/kirby-copilot-activation.png)

Enter the email you used for the purchase and the order number and hit the submit button. Done! Thanks for supporting our work. Once you activate your license, the license activation buttons will disappear.

::note
Your license key will be automatically stored in the `/site/config/.kirby-tools-licenses` file. Make sure to add this file to your `.gitignore` file to keep your license key private.
