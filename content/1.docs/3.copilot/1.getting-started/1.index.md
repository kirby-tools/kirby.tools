Kirby Copilot offers three ways to generate content. Choose the one that fits your use case:

| Method                                                                                     | Best For                                            | Key Features                                    |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| [:icon{name="i-ri-layout-top-line"} View Button](/docs/copilot/usage/view-button)          | Multi-field generation, quick access                | Generate all fields at once from any Panel view |
| [:icon{name="i-ri-edit-line"} Toolbar Buttons](/docs/copilot/usage/toolbar-buttons)        | In-field editing for `writer` and `textarea` fields | Append or replace text, work with selected text |
| [:icon{name="i-ri-magic-line"} Inline Suggestions](/docs/copilot/usage/inline-suggestions) | Inline suggestions in `writer` fields               | Tab to accept, ghost text preview               |
| [:icon{name="i-ri-dashboard-line"} Copilot Section](/docs/copilot/usage/section)           | Dedicated workflows                                 | Single field focus, auto file context           |

The **Panel view button** is the easiest way to get started – add it to your blueprint and generate content for a single field or multiple fields at once.

## View Button

With the `copilot` view button, you can access the prompt dialog from anywhere in the Panel. It is especially useful for generating content for multiple fields at once, but it works equally well for single fields.

Open the dialog, select the fields you want to generate content for, and let your AI assistant handle the rest.

## Writer and Textarea Fields

Kirby Copilot integrates directly into `writer` and `textarea` fields with two complementary features:

**Inline Suggestions** appear as ghost text after a brief pause in typing – press `Tab` to accept or keep typing to dismiss. This feature is enabled by default for all writer fields.

**Toolbar Buttons** open the prompt dialog for more control. Select text before clicking to use it as context, then choose to replace or append the generated content.

Learn more in the **Toolbar Buttons** and **[Inline Suggestions](/docs/copilot/usage/inline-suggestions)** documentation.
::

## Blocks & Layout Generation

One of Kirby Copilot's key features is its ability to generate content for `blocks` and `layout` fields. This feature is especially useful for creating content for complex layouts such as landing pages, product pages, and blog posts.

::tip
Copilot discovers your project's custom block definitions and generates content based on their structure. No additional configuration is required.
