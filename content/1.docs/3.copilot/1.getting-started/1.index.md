## Features

Kirby Copilot offers a variety of features for AI-assisted content creation and editing. These features make the process easy for you, your clients, and your editors.

- ðŸ¦™ **Multi-model**: Use OpenAI models, Google Gemini, Anthropic Claude, or Mistral AI models to generate content.
- ðŸ§± **Structure-Aware Generation**: Generate entire layouts from a single prompt, based on your project's unique block definitions.
- ðŸ“‡ **In-Context Editing**: Use the Copilot button in writer/textarea fields to refine text with AI assistance. Works perfectly with selected text.
- ðŸŒž **Customizable prompts**: Tailor AI responses with user and system instructions.
- ðŸŽ€ **Rich Context**: Go beyond text. Use other fields, images, and even PDF documents as context for more accurate and relevant AI responses.

::note
Kirby Copilot supports multiple AI providers including [OpenAI models](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models), [Google Gemini](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api), [Anthropic Claude](https://www.anthropic.com/claude), and [Mistral models](https://mistral.ai). We will add support for other AI providers if there is enough demand.

## Panel View Button :u-badge{label="since v2.5.0" class="align-middle mb-1 ml-2 rounded-full" variant="subtle"}

With the `copilot` Panel view button, you can access the prompt dialog from anywhere in the Panel. It is especially useful for generating content for multiple fields at once, such as when creating a new page or editing an existing one.

Open the dialog, select the fields you want to generate content for, and let Kirby Copilot do the rest.

## Blocks & Layout Generation :u-badge{label="since v2.4.0" class="align-middle mb-1 ml-2 rounded-full" variant="subtle"}

One of Kirby Copilot's key features is its ability to generate content for `blocks` and `layout` fields. This feature is especially useful for creating content for complex layouts such as landing pages, product pages, and blog posts.

::tip
Copilot reads your project's block definitions and generates content based on their structure. No additional configuration is required.

## Writer & Textarea Toolbar Buttons

The Kirby Copilot plugin provides two toolbar buttons:

- **Writer**: For `writer` fields, to generate rich text content.
- **Textarea**: For `textarea` fields, to generate plain text or Markdown content.

Clicking a button opens the prompt dialog where you can enter text to generate content for the field.

:prose-video{src="/vid/kirby-copilot-generate-layouts.mp4" poster="/vid/kirby-copilot-generate-layouts-poster-start.jpg" width="908" height="540"}

The toolbar buttons allow you to work with the selected text or the entire field content. If [any text is selected](/docs/copilot/usage/toolbar-buttons#selected-text), an additional selection menu will appear to choose whether to replace the selected text with the generated content or to append the generated content to the selected text.
