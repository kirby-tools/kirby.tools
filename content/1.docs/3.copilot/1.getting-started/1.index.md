## Blocks & Layout Generation

One of Kirby Copilot's key features is its ability to generate content for `blocks` and `layout` fields. This feature is especially useful for creating content for complex layouts such as landing pages, product pages, and blog posts.

::tip
Copilot reads your project's block definitions and generates content based on every block's structure. No additional configuration is required.

Learn more about this feature in the [Blocks & Layout Generation](/docs/copilot/usage/blocks-and-layouts) documentation.

## Writer & Textarea Toolbar Button

The Kirby Copilot plugin provides a button for the toolbar of `writer` and `textarea` fields in the Panel. Click the button to open the prompt dialog. This allows you to generate content based on the selected text or the entire content of the field. If any text is selected, it will be [appended to the prompt](/docs/copilot/usage/toolbar-buttons#selected-text).
