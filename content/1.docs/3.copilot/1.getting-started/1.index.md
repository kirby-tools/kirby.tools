## Features

Kirby Copilot offers a variety of features for AI-assisted content creation and editing. These features make the process easy for you, your clients, and your editors.

- 🦙 **Multi-model**: Use OpenAI models, Google Gemini, Anthropic Claude, or Mistral AI models to generate content.
- 🧱 **Structure-Aware Generation**: Generate entire layouts from a single prompt, based on your project's unique block definitions.
- 📇 **In-Context Editing**: Use the Copilot button in writer/textarea fields to refine text with AI assistance. Works perfectly with selected text.
- 🌞 **Customizable prompts**: Tailor AI responses with user and system instructions.
- 🎀 **Rich Context**: Go beyond text. Use other fields, images, and even PDF documents as context for more accurate and relevant AI responses.

## Blocks & Layout Generation :u-badge{label="since v2.4.0" class="align-middle ml-2 rounded-full" variant="soft"}

One of Kirby Copilot's key features is its ability to generate content for `blocks` and `layout` fields. This feature is especially useful for creating content for complex layouts such as landing pages, product pages, and blog posts.

::tip
Copilot reads your project's block definitions and generates content based on their structure. No additional configuration is required.

Learn more about this feature in the [Blocks & Layout Generation](/docs/copilot/usage/blocks-and-layouts) documentation.

## Panel View Button :u-badge{label="since v2.5.0" class="align-middle ml-2 rounded-full" variant="soft"}

With the `copilot` Panel view button, you can access the prompt dialog from anywhere in the Panel. This is particularly useful if you want to generate content for multiple fields at once. Open the dialog, select the fields you want to generate content for, and let Kirby Copilot do the rest.

## Writer & Textarea Toolbar Button

The Kirby Copilot plugin provides a button for the toolbar of `writer` and `textarea` fields in the Panel. Click the button to open the prompt dialog. This allows you to generate content based on the selected text or the entire content of the field. If any text is selected, it will be [appended to the prompt](/docs/copilot/usage/toolbar-buttons#selected-text).
