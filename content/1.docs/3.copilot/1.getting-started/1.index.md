## Features

Kirby Copilot offers AI-assisted content creation and editing. These features make the process easy for you, your clients, and your editors.

- ⚡ **[Tab Completions](/docs/copilot/usage/auto-completion)**: Accept AI suggestions inline with Tab. Ghost text preview shows completions as you type.
- 🦙 **Multi-model**: Use OpenAI models, Google Gemini, Anthropic Claude, or Mistral AI models.
- 🧱 **Structure-Aware Generation**: Generate entire layouts from a single prompt, based on your project's unique block definitions.
- 📇 **In-Context Editing**: Use the Copilot button in writer/textarea fields to refine text. Works perfectly with selected text.
- 🌞 **Customizable prompts**: Tailor AI responses with user and system instructions. Save frequently used prompts as templates.
- 🎀 **Rich Context**: Use other fields, images, and PDF documents as context for relevant AI responses.
- 🔒 **Secure by Default**: API keys are protected via server-side proxy – never exposed to Panel users.
- ↩️ **Undo & Cancel**: Revert generated content instantly or cancel generation mid-stream.

## Choosing Your Workflow

Kirby Copilot offers three ways to generate content. Choose the one that fits your use case:

| Method                                                   | Best For                                          | Key Features                                            |
| -------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| [Panel View Button](/docs/copilot/usage/view-button)     | Multi-field generation, quick access              | Generate all fields at once from any Panel view         |
| [Toolbar Buttons](/docs/copilot/usage/toolbar-buttons)   | In-field editing (`writer` and `textarea` fields) | Selected text context, prompt templates                 |
| [Auto-Completion](/docs/copilot/usage/auto-completion)   | Inline suggestions in `writer` fields             | Tab completions, ghost text preview                     |
| [Copilot Section](/docs/copilot/usage/section)           | Dedicated workflows                               | Persistent prompts, admin control, file pages           |

The **Panel view button** is the easiest way to get started – just add it to your blueprint and generate content for multiple fields with a single prompt.

::note
Kirby Copilot supports multiple AI providers including [OpenAI models](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models), [Google Gemini](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api), [Anthropic Claude](https://www.anthropic.com/claude), and [Mistral models](https://mistral.ai).

## Panel View Button :u-badge{label="since v2.5.0" class="align-middle mb-1 ml-2 rounded-full" variant="subtle"}

With the `copilot` Panel view button, you can access the prompt dialog from anywhere in the Panel. It is especially useful for generating content for multiple fields at once, such as when creating a new page or editing an existing one.

Open the dialog, select the fields you want to generate content for, and let Kirby Copilot do the rest.

## Blocks & Layout Generation :u-badge{label="since v2.4.0" class="align-middle mb-1 ml-2 rounded-full" variant="subtle"}

One of Kirby Copilot's key features is its ability to generate content for `blocks` and `layout` fields. This feature is especially useful for creating content for complex layouts such as landing pages, product pages, and blog posts.

::tip
Copilot reads your project's block definitions and generates content based on their structure. No additional configuration is required.

## Writer & Textarea Toolbar Buttons

The Kirby Copilot plugin provides two toolbar buttons:

- **Writer**: For `writer` fields, to generate rich text content.
- **Textarea**: For `textarea` fields, to generate plain text or Markdown content.

Clicking a button opens the prompt dialog where you can enter text to generate content for the field.

:prose-video{src="/vid/kirby-copilot-writer-prompt-dialog.mp4" poster="/vid/kirby-copilot-writer-prompt-dialog-poster.jpg" width="908" height="540"}

The toolbar buttons allow you to work with the selected text or the entire field content. If [any text is selected](/docs/copilot/usage/toolbar-buttons#selected-text), an additional selection menu will appear to choose whether to replace the selected text with the generated content or to append the generated content to the selected text.
