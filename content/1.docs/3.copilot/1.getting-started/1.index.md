## Blocks Generation

One of the key features of Kirby Copilot is the ability to generate content for block fields. This feature is especially useful when creating content for complex layouts such as landing pages, product pages, or blog posts.

## Writer & Textarea Toolbar Button

Open the prompt dialog by clicking the Copilot button in the toolbar. It allows you to work with content in a `writer` or `textarea` field. The selected text (if any) will be added to any prompt you write.

This feature is useful when you need to generate content based on existing text, or when you want to generate content for a specific part of the text. It is also useful for nested fields such as writer fields in blocks.
