## Kirby Query Language (KQL)

```yaml [pages/default.yml]
sections:
  content:
    type: fields
    fields:
      blocks:
        label: Blocks
        type: blocks

  copilot:
    type: copilot
    field: blocks
    userPrompt: "{{ page.myPrompt.value }}"
    editable: false
    files: false
```

## Panel File as Context Source

On a Kirby file page, you can pre-select the **current file** as context for the user prompt. This is useful if you want to generate text for a specific file, such as an image or PDF, that has already been uploaded to the Panel.

Consider the following scenario: Your client is concerned about accessibility and wants to use alternative texts for all the images on their website. It would be too cumbersome to manually select each image as the context for the prompt. Instead, you can set the `files` option to `auto` and let the plugin automatically read the uploaded file:

:prose-video{src="/vid/kirby-copilot-generate-image-alt.mp4" poster="/vid/kirby-copilot-generate-image-alt-poster.jpg" width="960" height="540"}

The following example shows how to use the current file of a Kirby file model as context for the user prompt:

```yaml [files/image.yml]
sections:
  content:
    type: fields
    fields:
      alt:
        label: Alternative Text
        type: text

  copilot:
    type: copilot
    # Write the generated text to the `alt` field
    field: alt
    # Provide a pre-defined user prompt
    userPrompt: Write an alternative text for the provided image. Use a maximum of 10 words.
    # Prevent the user from editing the prompt
    editable: false
    # Use the file of the current Kirby file model as context
    files: auto
```
