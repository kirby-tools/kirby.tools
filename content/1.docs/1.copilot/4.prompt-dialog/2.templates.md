Templates for user prompts can be shared between both the [view button](/docs/copilot/usage/view-button) for multi-field generation and the [toolbar buttons](/docs/copilot/usage/toolbar-buttons) for inline text generation.

## Default Templates :u-badge{label="since v3.0.0" class="align-middle mb-1 ml-2 rounded-full" variant="subtle"}

Kirby Copilot includes five built-in prompt templates that cover common text generation tasks. They can be selected from the templates dropdown in the prompt dialog.

- **Fix Grammar**: Correct grammar and spelling errors
- **Make Concise**: Shorten text while preserving meaning
- **Simplify**: Rewrite in simpler language
- **Extend**: Expand on the existing content
- **Summarize**: Create a brief summary

### Managing Prompt Templates

Click the bookmark icon in the prompt dialog to open a dropdown menu. From here, you can select **Save as template** to store the current prompt, or choose one of your existing templates to apply it.

To organize your templates, select **Edit templates** from the dropdown. This opens a nested dialog where you can add new templates, rename existing ones, reorder them by dragging, or delete prompts you no longer need.
