## Step 2: Start Using the Minimap

Once installed, the minimap automatically integrates into your Panel interface. No additional configuration is required – the plugin works out of the box.

Navigate to any page or content view, and you will notice the minimap appears on the right side of the Panel interface when editing content.

### Navigation States

The minimap has two states that you can toggle between by clicking the arrow button at the top of the minimap interface:

1. **Collapsed State**  
   Displays a minimal vertical indicator with positional markers for each field, maintaining an unobtrusive presence.

2. **Expanded State**  
   Reveals the complete navigation interface, showing field names and block details.
