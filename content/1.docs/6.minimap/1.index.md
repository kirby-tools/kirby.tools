---

The Kirby Minimap plugin offers structured sidebar navigation for the Panel, providing an overview of all fields and blocks in your current view. With one glance, you can see the entire structure of your content, which makes it easier to navigate and edit page blueprints with numerous fields or extensive block configurations.

## Requirements

- Kirby 4+ or Kirby 5+

## Step 1: Install the Plugin

The Minimap plugin is completely free and requires no license activation. Simply install it and start enhancing your editing workflow immediately.

### Composer

The recommended way to install the plugin is via Composer. Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
composer require johannschopplich/kirby-minimap
```

### Download

Head over to the [releases page](https://github.com/johannschopplich/kirby-minimap/releases) and download the latest version as a ZIP file. Extract the contents to your `site/plugins` folder:

```
site/plugins/
├─ kirby-minimap/
│  └─ … All plugin files
```

## Step 2: Start Using the Minimap

Once installed, the minimap automatically integrates into your Panel interface. No additional configuration is required – the plugin works out of the box.

Navigate to any page or content view, and you will notice the minimap appears on the right side of the Panel interface when editing content.

### Navigation States

The minimap has two states that you can toggle between by clicking the arrow button at the top of the minimap interface:

1. **Collapsed State**  
   Displays a minimal vertical indicator with positional markers for each field, maintaining an unobtrusive presence.

2. **Expanded State**  
   Reveals the complete navigation interface, showing field names and block details.
