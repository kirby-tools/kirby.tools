The Minimap plugin displays fields from your blueprint in a structured sidebar. This page explains how different field types are rendered and what information is shown.

## Field Display

Each field in your blueprint appears in the minimap with its label. The minimap reads the field configuration from your blueprint and displays the label you defined.

### Required Fields

Fields marked as `required: true` in your blueprint are indicated with a star symbol in the minimap. This helps content editors quickly identify which fields need to be filled out.

### Excluded Field Types

Contentless field types are automatically excluded from the minimap to keep the navigation clean and focused on editable content:

- `gap`
- `hidden`
- `line`

## Block Fields

Block fields receive special treatment in the minimap. Instead of showing just the field name, the minimap displays each block individually, giving you a detailed overview of your content structure.

### Block Icons

Each block in the minimap is displayed with its type icon. The icon is determined by:

1. The icon defined in your block's blueprint (if specified).
2. A fallback `box` icon for blocks without a custom icon.

### Content Preview

Blocks show a short text preview extracted from their content. The preview displays the first 50 characters of the block's text content, giving you a quick glimpse of what each block contains.

### Click to Navigate

Clicking on any block in the minimap scrolls the Panel view to that block. When navigating to a block, it briefly highlights with a pulse animation to help you locate it in the content editor.
