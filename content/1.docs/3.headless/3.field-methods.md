## `toResolvedBlocks()`

The `toResolvedBlocks()` method is a wrapper around Kirby's [`toBlocks()`](https://getkirby.com/docs/reference/templates/field-methods/to-blocks) method. It resolves fields in blocks to the desired output by running them through resolver functions.

For example, the `toBlocks()` method returns UUIDs for the `files` and `pages` fields. To leave these UUIDs as they are would require you to resolve them in your frontend application. Instead, you can use the `toResolvedBlocks()` method to resolve these UUIDs into file and page objects on the server. This way, you can access the properties of these objects directly in your frontend.

When using `toBlocks()`, a single block as part of the blocks JSON response might look like this:

```json
{
  "content": {
    "image": ["file://BYXR0pvumEbfTknP"],
    "alt": "Staring at stars"
  },
  "id": "a1c0f653-2e36-4b07-a7fa-d22ef27dd114",
  "isHidden": false,
  "type": "image"
}
```

Instead, when using `toResolvedBlocks()`, the same block would look as follows. Note that the `image` field is now resolved to a file object:

```json
{
  "content": {
    "alt": "Staring at stars",
    "image": {
      "url": "http://cacao-kit-backend.test/media/pages/notes/exploring-the-universe/a6c422e141-1714659501/tent-in-the-woods.jpg",
      "width": 1024,
      "height": 683
    }
  },
  "id": "a1c0f653-2e36-4b07-a7fa-d22ef27dd114",
  "isHidden": false,
  "type": "image"
}
```

You can define which fields of which blocks need resolving in your `config.php`. To simplify `files` and `pages` resolving, Kirby Headless comes with default resolvers for these fields. You can also define custom resolvers for specific fields in specific blocks.

For a production-ready boilerplate, you can use the 🍫 [Cacao Kit frontend](https://github.com/johannschopplich/cacao-kit-frontend) which uses this field method.

### Files and Pages Resolver

In most cases, you want to resolve the `files` and `pages` fields in your blocks. To do so, you can define which fields of which blocks should be resolved in your `config.php`:

```php [config.php]
return [
    'blocksResolver' => [
        // Define which fields of which blocks should be resolved
        'files' => [
            // Resolve the `image` field in the `intro` block as a file
            'intro' => ['image']
        ],
        'pages' => [
            // Resolve the `link` field in the `note` block as a page
            'note' => ['link']
        ]
    ]
];
```

Now, all `files` and `pages` fields in the `intro` and `note` blocks will be resolved to file and page objects, respectively.

You can customize the resolver output by defining a custom resolver (overriding the default resolvers) for the `files` and `pages` fields in your `config.php`. Both resolver options accept a closure that takes the `File` or `Page` model as its argument and returns an array of properties, just like the default resolver.

For reference, the default values for the `files` and `pages` resolvers are:

```php [config.php]
return [
    'blocksResolver' => [
        'defaultResolvers' => [
            'files' => fn (\Kirby\Cms\File $image) => [
              'url' => $image->url(),
              'width' => $image->width(),
              'height' => $image->height(),
              'srcset' => $image->srcset(),
              'alt' => $image->alt()->value()
            ],
            'pages' => fn (\Kirby\Cms\Page $page) => [
                'uri' => $page->uri(),
                'title' => $page->title()->value()
            ]
        ]
    ]
];
```

### Custom Resolvers

Default resolvers are probably not enough for your use case. If you need a custom resolver for links, structures, or any other field in a particular block, you can use the `blocksResolver.resolvers` option. It takes an array of resolvers, where the key is `{blockName}:{fieldName}` and the value is a closure that takes the field and block as its arguments and returns an array of properties.

You have complete control over the output of the resolved fields. For example, you can resolve the `link` field of the `intro` block to a custom output:

```php [config.php]
use Kirby\Cms\Block;
use Kirby\Content\Field;

return [
    'blocksResolver' => [
        'resolvers' => [
            // Resolve the field `link` of the block `intro` to a custom output
            'intro:link' => fn (Field $field, Block $block) => [
                'value' => $field->value(),
                'uri' => $field->toPage()?->uri()
            ]
            // Resolve the KirbyText of the field `text` of the `note` block
            'note:text' => function (Field $field, Block $block) {
                return $field->kirbytext()->value()
            }
        ]
    ]
];
```

### Replace Field Values

By default, resolved fields will replace the source field values in the given block. If you want to keep the source field values and store the resolved content in a separate key, you can set the `resolvedKey` option to a custom key:

```php [config.php]
return [
    'blocksResolver' => [
        'resolvedKey' => 'resolved'
    ]
];
```

With this configuration, all resolved fields will be stored in a key named `resolved`, leaving the original field values untouched. A resolved block might look like this:

```json
{
  "content": {
    "alt": "Staring at stars",
    "image": ["file://BYXR0pvumEbfTknP"],
    "resolved": {
      "image": {
        "url": "http://cacao-kit-backend.test/media/pages/notes/exploring-the-universe/a6c422e141-1714659501/tent-in-the-woods.jpg",
        "width": 1024,
        "height": 683
      }
    }
  },
  "id": "a1c0f653-2e36-4b07-a7fa-d22ef27dd114",
  "isHidden": false,
  "type": "image"
}
```

## `resolvePermalinks()`

::callout{icon="i-ri-information-line"}
Acts the same as Kirby's built-in `permalinksToUrls()` method, but supports a custom URL parser.
::

This field method resolves page and file permalinks to their respective URLs. It is primarily intended for usage with KQL queries, since the value of `writer` fields contains permalink URLs such as `/@/page/nDvVIAwDBph4uOpm`. But the method works with any field values that contains permalinks in `href` or `src` attributes.

For headless usage, you may want to remove the origin from the URL and just return the path. You can do this by defining a custom URL parser in your `config.php`:

```php [config.php]
return [
    'permalinksResolver' => [
        // Strip the origin from the URL
        'urlParser' => function (string $url, \Kirby\Cms\App $kirby) {
            $path = parse_url($url, PHP_URL_PATH);
            return $path;
        }
    ]
];
```

Or in multi-language setups, you may want to remove a language prefix like `/de` from the URL:

```php [config.php]
return [
    'permalinksResolver' => [
        // Strip the language code prefix from German URLs
        'urlParser' => function (string $url, \Kirby\Cms\App $kirby) {
            $path = parse_url($url, PHP_URL_PATH);

            if (str_starts_with($path, '/de')) {
                return substr($path, 3);
            }

            return $path;
        }
    ]
];
```

## `toResolvedLayouts()`

The `toResolvedLayouts()` method is a wrapper around Kirby's [`toLayouts()`](https://getkirby.com/docs/reference/templates/field-methods/to-layouts) method. Under the hood, it uses the `toResolvedBlocks()` method to resolve fields in blocks. You can use the same `files`, `pages`, and custom resolvers as with the `toResolvedBlocks()` method.
