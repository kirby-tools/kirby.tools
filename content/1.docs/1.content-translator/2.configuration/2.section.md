description: Configure Content Translator sections in your blueprints with fine-grained control.
---

The Content Translator section gives you fine-grained control over which blueprints should have content translation buttons. This allows you to decide which content is translatable and which is not.

## Basic Setup

Add the following basic section configuration to a blueprint file:

```yaml [pages/default.yml]
sections:
  contentTranslator:
    type: content-translator
```

This is how the section will look in the default language:

::preview{src="/img/kirby-content-translator-section.png" alt="Content Translator section in default language" width="1026" height="204"}
::

When switching to secondary languages, the section buttons will change to **Import** and **Translate**:

::preview{src="/img/kirby-content-translator-section-secondary-languages.png" alt="Content Translator section in secondary language" width="1026" height="204"}
::

## Section Options

::tip
When [configured globally](/docs/content-translator/configuration/global), these options will apply to all sections. You can override them in individual blueprints.
::

### `label` :u-badge{label="String" class="align-middle ml-2 !rounded-full" variant="subtle"}

The `label` property allows you to define a custom label for the Content Translator section. The default value depends on the language of the Panel. For English, the default label is `Content Translator`.

To set a custom label for the plugin section, use the `label` property in your blueprint:

```yaml [sections/content-translator.yml]
type: content-translator
label: Translation Helper
```

### `importFrom` :u-badge{label="String" class="align-middle ml-2 !rounded-full" variant="subtle"}

::note
With the default plugin configuration, the import process will only allow copying content from the default language to secondary languages. Not the other way around. This protects the content of the default language from being overwritten. That's why in the default language only the **{Language} â†’ All Languages** button is rendered:

<br>
<br>

::preview{src="/img/kirby-content-translator-section.png" alt="Content Translator section in default language" width="1026" height="204"}
::

::

To allow overwriting content of the default language by importing from a secondary language, you can set the `importFrom` property to `all`. This will enable you to import content from the secondary language to the default language:

```yaml [sections/content-translator.yml]
type: content-translator
importFrom: all
```

The button text will change slightly to indicate that importing from secondary languages is allowed:

::preview{src="/img/kirby-content-translator-section-import-all.png" alt="Content Translator section with import all option" width="1026" height="204"}
::

::warning
This feature is disabled by default to prevent accidental overwriting of content. Use this feature with caution.
::

### `import` :u-badge{label="Boolean" class="align-middle ml-2 !rounded-full" variant="subtle"}

If the importing of content to any page should be disabled, you can set the `import` property to `false`. This will hide the import button in the section.

```yaml [sections/content-translator.yml]
type: content-translator
import: false
```

### `batch` :u-badge{label="Boolean" class="align-middle ml-2 !rounded-full" variant="subtle"}

::note
This option was called `bulk` in previous versions of the plugin. The `bulk` option is still supported for backwards compatibility, but it is recommended to use `batch` instead.
::

Kirby Content Translator allows you to translate the content of a given site, page or file model into all secondary languages in batch mode. This means that you can now not only translate content per language, but also for all secondary languages at once: the content of all secondary languages is overwritten with the data of the default language and then translated into the respective language.

This option is only active for the default language:

::preview{src="/img/kirby-content-translator-section.png" alt="Content Translator section in default language" width="1026" height="204"}
::

::warning
Unlike per-language translation, this translation process **is not reversible** in the Panel and is handled server-side. Use it with caution, as it may take a while to translate all content.
::

The button is only enabled when the default language content is active in the Panel. When the button is clicked, a dialog with checkboxes for each secondary language is displayed. You can select the languages into which you want to translate the content, and then click the **Translate** button to start the batch mode translation process.

::preview-dialog{src="/img/kirby-content-translator-dialog-batch-translation.png" alt="Content Translator batch translation dialog" width="960" height="700"}
::

For security reasons, the confirmation modal cannot be disabled with the [`confirm`](#confirm) property.

If you want to _disable_ batch translations for multiple languages at once, you can set the `batch` property to `false`. This will hide the batch mode translation button in the section:

```yaml [sections/content-translator.yml]
type: content-translator
batch: false
```

::preview{src="/img/kirby-content-translator-section-batch-disabled.png" alt="Content Translator section with batch translation disabled" width="1026" height="342"}
::

### `title` :u-badge{label="Boolean" class="align-middle ml-2 !rounded-full" variant="subtle"}

You can enable to import and translate the title of a model by setting the `title` section property to `true`:

```yaml [sections/content-translator.yml]
type: content-translator
title: true
```

::note
Technically speaking, the title is not part of the content history of a Kirby model. That's why you can't revert unsaved changes made to the title, as opposed to fields. Copying or translating the title will overwrite the existing title without the possibility to undo the changes. Because of these caveats, have to opt-in to import and translate the title.
::

### `slug` :u-badge{label="Boolean" class="align-middle ml-2 !rounded-full" variant="subtle"}

Similar to the `title` property, you can enable to import and translate the slug of a model by setting the `slug` section property to `true`. This will change the slug of the model to the slugified translation of the translated title.

```yaml [sections/content-translator.yml]
type: content-translator
slug: true
```

### `confirm` :u-badge{label="Boolean" class="align-middle ml-2 !rounded-full" variant="subtle"}

To make sure an editor does not accidentally import or translate content and thus overwrite existing translations, a confirmation dialog is displayed before the process is started. If you want to skip this dialog, you can set the `confirm` key to `false`:

```yaml [sections/content-translator.yml]
type: content-translator
confirm: false
```

### `fieldTypes` :u-badge{label="Array" class="align-middle ml-2 !rounded-full" variant="subtle"}

This is one of the core options. By default, the plugin imports or translates all text-like fields: `list`, `tags`, `text`, `textarea`, `writer`, and `markdown`. These fields can be nested within `blocks`, `layout`, `object`, and `structure` fields.

If you want to limit the translation to specific field types, you can use the `fieldTypes` property. The following field types are supported (and enabled by default):

- `blocks`
- `layout`
- `list`
- `object`
- `structure`
- `tags`
- `text`
- `textarea`
- `writer`
- `markdown` (from the [markdown field plugin](https://github.com/fabianmichael/kirby-markdown-field))

To only translate `text` and `textarea` fields, use the following configuration:

```yaml [sections/content-translator.yml]
type: content-translator
fieldTypes:
  - text
  - textarea
```

However, `text` fields inside `blocks` for example will not be imported or translated with this configuration, because the `blocks` field type is not included. To translate fields within blocks, you need to add the `blocks` field type to the `fieldTypes` array:

```yaml [sections/content-translator.yml]
type: content-translator
fieldTypes:
  - blocks
  - text
  - textarea
```

::note
When `translate: false` is set on a field, it will be ignored by the translation process, regardless of the `fieldTypes` configuration.
::

### `includeFields` :u-badge{label="Array" class="align-middle ml-2 !rounded-full" variant="subtle"}

The `includeFields` property allows you to specify a list of fields that should be imported or translated. This property is useful if you want to translate only specific fields, either nested or not. The `fieldTypes` property is still respected.

::note
When using the `includeFields` property, all fields are filtered by their key. The key is case-insensitive, meaning that `text` and `Text` are treated as the same field.
::

To translate only the `company` and `author` fields, use the following configuration:

```yaml [sections/content-translator.yml]
type: content-translator
includeFields:
  - company
  - author
```

### `excludeFields` :u-badge{label="Array" class="align-middle ml-2 !rounded-full" variant="subtle"}

Similar to the `includeFields` property, the `excludeFields` property allows you to specify a list of fields that should not be imported or translated. This property is useful if you want to exclude specific fields from the translation process when excluding a field type is not sufficient.

::note
If a field already has the `translate: false` option set, it will be ignored by the translation process. You can skip the `excludeFields` configuration for these fields.
::

To exclude the `description` and `summary` fields from the translation, use the following configuration:

```yaml [sections/content-translator.yml]
type: content-translator
excludeFields:
  - description
  - summary
```

### `kirbyTags` :u-badge{label="Array" class="align-middle ml-2 !rounded-full" variant="subtle"}

This option allows you to configure selective translation of KirbyTags attributes. By default, all KirbyTags are excluded from translation in order to preserve URLs, filenames, and technical attributes. With this option, you can specify which KirbyTag types and which attributes within those tags should be translated.

```yaml [sections/content-translator.yml]
type: content-translator
kirbyTags:
  # Translate link text and title in `(link: ...)` KirbyTags
  link:
    - text
    - title
  # Translate image alt text and title in `(image: ...)` KirbyTags
  image:
    - alt
    - title
    - caption
  # Translate file text and title in `(file: ...)` KirbyTags
  file:
    - text
    - title
  # Translate email text and title in `(email: ...)` KirbyTags
  email:
    - text
    - title
  # Translate video caption in `(video: ...)` KirbyTags
  video:
    - caption
```

The configuration is an associative array where:

- **Keys** are KirbyTag types (e.g., `link`, `image`, `file`)
- **Values** are arrays of attribute names that should be translated

For more details and examples, see the [KirbyTags Configuration](/docs/content-translator/configuration/kirbytags) guide.

::warning
Only configure KirbyTags that you actually use and be selective with translatable attributes to ensure good performance and avoid unnecessary translations.
