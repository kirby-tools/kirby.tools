## DeepL Configuration

DeepL offers a variety of options to customize the text translation API endpoint. To learn more about the available options, please refer to the [DeepL translate text parameters](https://developers.deepl.com/docs/api-reference/translate#request-body-descriptions).

To set custom request options for the DeepL API, add them to the plugin's `requestOptions` configuration:

```php [config.php]
return [
    'johannschopplich.content-translator' => [
        'DeepL' => [
            // All available options can be found in the DeepL API documentation:
            // https://developers.deepl.com/docs/api-reference/translate#request-body-descriptions
            'requestOptions' => [
                // Lean towards formal language
                'formality' => 'more'
            ]
        ]
    ]
];
```
