description: Configure Content Translator view buttons and sections in your blueprints as needed.
---

Kirby Content Translator supports configuration through view buttons and sections, providing fine-grained control over translation behavior. Both approaches support the same configuration options and can be used together.

## View Button Configuration

::note
View buttons are available in **Kirby 5+**. For Kirby 4, the view button is shown by default and can be controlled via the [`viewButton` global option](/docs/content-translator/configuration/global).
::

In Kirby 5, you can add the Content Translator view button to any blueprint and configure its behavior with props:

::code-group

```yaml [site.yml]
buttons:
  preview: true
  content-translator:
    title: true
    slug: true
    excludeFields:
      - description
  languages: true
```

```yaml [pages/default.yml]
buttons:
  preview: true
  settings: true
  content-translator:
    title: true
    slug: true
    excludeFields:
      - description
  languages: true
  status: true
```

```yaml [files/default.yml]
buttons:
  preview: true
  settings: true
  content-translator:
    title: true
    slug: true
    excludeFields:
      - description
  languages: true
```

::

## Section Configuration

Add the Content Translator section to any blueprint and configure its behavior with props:

::code-group

```yaml [Basic Section]
sections:
  contentTranslator:
    type: content-translator
```

```yaml [Configured Section]
sections:
  contentTranslator:
    type: content-translator
    title: true
    slug: true
    kirbyTags:
      link:
        - text
        - title
      image:
        - alt
        - caption
```

::

This is how the basic section will look in the default language:

::preview{src="/img/kirby-content-translator-section.png" alt="Content Translator section in default language" width="1026" height="204"}
::

When switching to secondary languages, the section buttons will change to **Import** and **Translate**:

::preview{src="/img/kirby-content-translator-section-secondary-languages.png" alt="Content Translator section in secondary language" width="1026" height="204"}
::

## Available Options

::tip
When [configured globally](/docs/content-translator/configuration/global), these options will apply to both view buttons and sections. Local configurations can override them.
::

### `label` :u-badge{label="String" class="align-middle ml-2 rounded-full!" variant="subtle"}

Custom label for the Content Translator view button or section. The default depends on the Panel language (e.g., "Content Translator" for English).

To change the label to "Translate":

::code-group

```yaml [View Button]
buttons:
  content-translator:
    label: Translate
```

```yaml [Section]
sections:
  contentTranslator:
    type: content-translator
    label: Translate
```

::

### `importFrom` :u-badge{label="String" class="align-middle ml-2 rounded-full!" variant="subtle"}

Controls import direction. Set to `all` to allow importing from any language to any language, including overwriting the default language with content from secondary languages:

::code-group

```yaml [View Button]
buttons:
  content-translator:
    importFrom: all
```

```yaml [Section]
sections:
  contentTranslator:
    type: content-translator
    importFrom: all
```

::

The button text will indicate that importing from secondary languages is allowed:

::preview{src="/img/kirby-content-translator-section-import-all.png" alt="Content Translator section with import all option" width="1026" height="204"}
::

::note
By default, Kirby Content Translator only allows importing from the default language to secondary languages to prevent accidental overwrites of the default language content. It renders the **{Language} → All Languages** button for batch translations in the default language:

<br>
<br>

::preview{src="/img/kirby-content-translator-section.png" alt="Content Translator section in default language" width="1026" height="204"}
::

::

::warning
By default, only importing from the default language to secondary languages is allowed to prevent accidental overwrites. Use `importFrom: all` with caution.
::

### `import` :u-badge{label="Boolean" class="align-middle ml-2 rounded-full!" variant="subtle"}

Enable or disable content importing functionality entirely.

To hide the import actions in the view button or section, set the `import` key to `false`:

::code-group

```yaml [View Button]
buttons:
  content-translator:
    import: false
```

```yaml [Section]
sections:
  contentTranslator:
    type: content-translator
    import: false
```

::

### `batch` :u-badge{label="Boolean" class="align-middle ml-2 rounded-full!" variant="subtle"}

Enable or disable batch translation (translating to multiple languages at once).

This option is only available for the default language:

::preview{src="/img/kirby-content-translator-section.png" alt="Content Translator section in default language" width="1026" height="204"}
::

::warning
Unlike per-language translation, this translation process **is not reversible** in the Panel and is handled server-side. Use it with caution, as it may take a while to translate all content.
::

When the button is clicked, a dialog with checkboxes for each secondary language is displayed. You can select the languages to translate the content into. Click the **Translate** button to start the batch mode translation process.

::preview-dialog{src="/img/kirby-content-translator-dialog-batch-translation.png" alt="Content Translator batch translation dialog" width="960" height="700"}
::

For security reasons, the confirmation modal cannot be disabled with the [`confirm`](#confirm) property.

If you want to _disable_ batch translations for multiple languages at once, you can set the `batch` property to `false`. This will hide the batch mode translation button in the view button or section:

::code-group

```yaml [View Button]
buttons:
  content-translator:
    batch: false
```

```yaml [Section]
sections:
  contentTranslator:
    type: content-translator
    batch: false
```

::

::note
This option was called `bulk` in previous versions. The `bulk` option is still supported for backwards compatibility.
::

### `title` :u-badge{label="Boolean" class="align-middle ml-2 rounded-full!" variant="subtle"}

Include the model title in import and translation operations. This is particularly useful for pages, where the title is often a key piece of content.

::code-group

```yaml [View Button]
buttons:
  content-translator:
    title: true
```

```yaml [Section]
sections:
  contentTranslator:
    type: content-translator
    title: true
```

::

::note
Title changes cannot be reverted in the content history, unlike field changes. Use with caution.
::

### `slug` :u-badge{label="Boolean" class="align-middle ml-2 rounded-full!" variant="subtle"}

Similar to the `title` property, the model slug can be included in import and translation operations. This is particularly useful for pages, where the slug is derived from the title. The slug will be generated from the translated title.

::code-group

```yaml [View Button]
buttons:
  content-translator:
    slug: true
```

```yaml [Section]
sections:
  contentTranslator:
    type: content-translator
    slug: true
```

::

### `confirm` :u-badge{label="Boolean" class="align-middle ml-2 rounded-full!" variant="subtle"}

Show confirmation dialogs before import or translation operations. This is enabled by default to prevent accidental overwrites of content.

If you want to skip this dialog, you can set the `confirm` key to `false`:

::code-group

```yaml [View Button]
buttons:
  content-translator:
    confirm: false
```

```yaml [Section]
sections:
  contentTranslator:
    type: content-translator
    confirm: false
```

::

### `fieldTypes` :u-badge{label="Array" class="align-middle ml-2 rounded-full!" variant="subtle"}

This is one of the most important options. Specify which field types to include in import and translation operations. By default, the plugin imports or translates all text-like fields: `list`, `tags`, `text`, `textarea`, `writer`, and `markdown`. These fields can be nested within `blocks`, `layout`, `object`, and `structure` fields.

**Default field types:**

- `blocks`
- `layout`
- `list`
- `object`
- `structure`
- `tags`
- `text`
- `textarea`
- `writer`
- `markdown` (from the [markdown field plugin](https://github.com/fabianmichael/kirby-markdown-field))
- `table` (from the [table field plugin](https://github.com/bogdancondorachi/kirby-table-field))

For example, to include only `text` and `textarea` fields in the translation:

::code-group

```yaml [View Button]
buttons:
  content-translator:
    fieldTypes:
      - text
      - textarea
```

```yaml [Section]
sections:
  contentTranslator:
    type: content-translator
    fieldTypes:
      - text
      - textarea
```

::

::note
To translate text fields within `blocks`, you must include both `blocks` and `text` in the `fieldTypes` array.
::

::tip
When `translate: false` is set on a field, it will be ignored by the translation process, regardless of the `fieldTypes` configuration.
::

### `includeFields` :u-badge{label="Array" class="align-middle ml-2 rounded-full!" variant="subtle"}

Specify specific fields to include in import and translation operations (field names are case-insensitive). This is useful if you want to translate only specific fields, either nested or not. The `fieldTypes` property is still respected.

::note
When using the `includeFields` property, all fields are filtered by their key. The key is case-insensitive, meaning that `text` and `Text` are treated as the same field.
::

For example, to include only `company` and `author` fields in the translation:

::code-group

```yaml [View Button]
buttons:
  content-translator:
    includeFields:
      - company
      - author
```

```yaml [Section]
sections:
  contentTranslator:
    type: content-translator
    includeFields:
      - company
      - author
```

::

### `excludeFields` :u-badge{label="Array" class="align-middle ml-2 rounded-full!" variant="subtle"}

Specify fields to exclude from the import and translation process (field names are case-insensitive). This is useful if you want to exclude _specific fields_ while still including all fields of certain types via `fieldTypes`.

For example, to exclude `description` and `summary` fields from translation:

::code-group

```yaml [View Button]
buttons:
  content-translator:
    excludeFields:
      - description
      - summary
```

```yaml [Section]
sections:
  contentTranslator:
    type: content-translator
    excludeFields:
      - description
      - summary
```

::

::note
Fields with `translate: false` in their blueprint definition are automatically excluded.
::

### `kirbyTags` :u-badge{label="Object" class="align-middle ml-2 rounded-full!" variant="subtle"}

Configure selective translation of KirbyTag types and its attributes (e.g., link text, image alt text). By default, all KirbyTags are excluded to preserve URLs, filenames, and technical attributes.

::code-group

```yaml [View Button]
buttons:
  content-translator:
    kirbyTags:
      # Translate link text and title in `(link: ...)` KirbyTags
      link:
        - text
        - title
      # Translate image alt text and title in `(image: ...)` KirbyTags
      image:
        - alt
        - title
        - caption
      # Translate file text and title in `(file: ...)` KirbyTags
      file:
        - text
        - title
      # Translate email text and title in `(email: ...)` KirbyTags
      email:
        - text
        - title
      # Translate video caption in `(video: ...)` KirbyTags
      video:
        - caption
```

```yaml [Section]
sections:
  contentTranslator:
    type: content-translator
    kirbyTags:
      # Translate link text and title in `(link: ...)` KirbyTags
      link:
        - text
        - title
      # Translate image alt text and title in `(image: ...)` KirbyTags
      image:
        - alt
        - title
        - caption
      # Translate file text and title in `(file: ...)` KirbyTags
      file:
        - text
        - title
      # Translate email text and title in `(email: ...)` KirbyTags
      email:
        - text
        - title
      # Translate video caption in `(video: ...)` KirbyTags
      video:
        - caption
```

::

For detailed KirbyTags configuration, see the [KirbyTags Configuration](/docs/content-translator/configuration/kirbytags) guide.

## Configuration Precedence

Configuration options are applied in the following order (later options override earlier ones):

1. **Default values** (built into the plugin)
2. **Global configuration** (in `config.php`)
3. **View button & section props** (in blueprints)

::code-group

```php [Global Config]
return [
    'johannschopplich.content-translator' => [
        'fieldTypes' => ['text', 'textarea'], // Applied globally
        'confirm' => false,
    ]
];
```

```yaml [Blueprint Override]
sections:
  contentTranslator:
    type: content-translator
    fieldTypes: # Overrides global config
      - blocks
      - text
      - textarea
    # confirm: false inherited from global config

buttons:
  content-translator:
    confirm: true # Overrides global config
```
