The Kirby Content Translator plugin empowers editors to translate content from one language to another. Translations can be done either language by language or in batches. The tool seamlessly integrates with the Kirby Panel and provides manual translation capabilities and programmatic access via its [PHP API](/docs/content-translator/advanced/php-api).

## Usage Overview

The plugin provides two main ways to translate content:

1. **Panel Integration**: Use view buttons or blueprint sections to translate content directly in the Kirby Panel.
2. **PHP API**: Programmatically translate content using PHP methods for automation or CLI commands.

## Translation Services

By default, the plugin uses the [DeepL API](https://www.deepl.com) for high-quality translations. If you prefer to use a different translation service, you can define [custom translation functions](/docs/content-translator/configuration/translator-function) to integrate other providers.
