Depending on your current language context, Kirby Content Translator works in two distinct modes. Understanding these modes will help you or your editors choose the right approach for your translation workflow.

## Overview

| Feature               | Per-Language Translation    | Batch Translation             |
| --------------------- | --------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| **Language Context**  | 🌍 Secondary language       | 🏠 Primary/default language   |
| **Translation Speed** | ⚡ Real-time, instant       | 🚀 Batch processing           |
| **Reversibility**     | ✅ Reversible changes       | ❌ Non-reversible             |
| **Interactivity**     | ✅ See & edit immediately   | ❌ Background processing      |
| **Target Languages**  | 🎯 Single language          | 📊 Multiple languages at once |
| **Use Case**          | 🔧 Fine-tuning translations | 🏗️ Initial content creation   |

## Batch Translation

When the primary language is active in the Kirby Panel, the plugin displays a **{Language} → All Languages** button to enable efficient bulk processing. Clicking this button opens a dialog where you can select multiple target languages for your page.

This translation mode is ideal for setting up initial content or translating content to several languages at once.

## Individual Language Translation

When one of the secondary languages is active, the plugin's Panel view button and section both feature the same buttons: **Import** and **Translate**.

- Click the **Import** button to copy the content from the default language to the currently active language.
- Click the **Translate** button to translate the content of the freshly imported content (which is still in the default language) into the secondary language you selected.

This is ideal for fine-tuning and reviewing translations for a specific language.
