## Step 1: Install the Plugin

Although it is a commercial plugin, you can download and test it in your local environment before purchasing.

::card{title="Composer" icon="i-ri-terminal-box-line"}
The recommended way to install the plugin is via Composer. Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
composer require johannschopplich/kirby-content-translator
```

::

::card{title="ZIP File Download" icon="i-ri-folder-zip-line"}
Download the :latest-version or head over to the [releases page](https://github.com/kirby-tools/kirby-content-translator/releases) to see all versions. Extract the ZIP file to your `site/plugins` folder.

::

## Step 2: Configure DeepL

By default, this plugin uses the [DeepL API](https://www.deepl.com) to translate your content. You can also use any other translation service by defining a [custom translator function](/docs/content-translator/configuration/translator-function).

To use the DeepL API, [create an account](https://www.deepl.com/de/pro-api) and [generate an API key](https://www.deepl.com/de/account/summary). The free account is sufficient for most use cases (500,000 characters per month).

Store the API key in your `config.php` file:

```php [config.php]
return [
    'johannschopplich.content-translator' => [
        'DeepL' => [
            // API key for the DeepL free or pro plan
            'apiKey' => '<deepl-api-key>'
        ]
    ]
];
```

## Step 3: Blueprint Setup

### View Button :u-badge{label="v3.0+" class="align-middle ml-2 rounded-full!" variant="subtle"}

![Kirby Content Translator Panel view button](/img/kirby-content-translator-view-buttons.png)

Kirby 5 introduces new extensions that allow custom view buttons in most Panel views (e.g., site, page, or file). The Content Translator plugin provides a dropdown button that can be added alongside the default Panel header buttons, such as the languages dropdown.

To add the `content-translator` dropdown button to a view, set the `buttons` option in the corresponding blueprint. The following example shows how to reference the default buttons and add the `content-translator` button to the `site`, `pages`, and `files` views:

::code-group

```yaml [site.yml]
buttons:
  - open
  - preview
  - content-translator # Re-order the button as needed
  - languages
```

```yaml [pages/default.yml]
buttons:
  - open
  - preview
  - settings
  - content-translator # Re-order the button as needed
  - languages
  - status
```

```yaml [files/default.yml]
buttons:
  - open
  - settings
  - content-translator # Re-order the button as needed
  - languages
```

::

Reference the default buttons and decide where to place the `content-translator` button.

::note
Kirby 4 does not support custom view buttons, but the `content-translator` button has been backported 🎉. It is always placed after the language dropdown and cannot be moved. Follow the [Configuration Guide](/docs/content-translator/configuration/global) for more information or how to disable it.
::

### Alternative: Section

If you prefer dedicated translation controls within the page content area, you can use the Content Translator section instead of (or in addition to) the view button:

```yaml [pages/default.yml]
sections:
  contentTranslator:
    type: content-translator
```

The section provides the same functionality as the view button but is placed within the blueprint layout. See the [Section Configuration](/docs/content-translator/configuration/local#section-configuration) for all available options.

This is how the section will look in the default language:

::preview{src="/img/kirby-content-translator-section.png" alt="Content Translator section in default language" width="1026" height="204"}
::

When switching to secondary languages, the section buttons will change to **Import** and **Translate**:

::preview{src="/img/kirby-content-translator-section-secondary-languages.png" alt="Content Translator section in secondary language" width="1026" height="204"}
::

## Step 4: Translate Your Content

Open the Panel and navigate to a page. The translation workflow depends on your current language:

### In Secondary Languages

1. Click **Import** to copy content from the default language to the current language.
2. Click **Translate** to send the imported content to DeepL for translation.

::tip{icon="i-ri-lightbulb-line"}
**Why two steps?** _Import_ copies the raw content first, then _Translate_ sends it to DeepL. This separation allows you to review content before translation or skip translation for content that does not need it.
::

### In the Default Language

Click **{Language} → All Languages** to translate content to multiple languages at once. A dialog lets you select which target languages to include.

::callout{icon="i-ri-settings-3-line" to="/docs/content-translator/configuration/global"}
By default, all text-like fields are translated. Customize which fields, types, and behaviors apply in the Configuration Guide.
::

## Step 5: Buy a License

You can test the plugin locally. However, you need to purchase a license to use the plugin in production environments.

Visit the [product page on Lemon Squeezy](https://byjohann.lemonsqueezy.com/buy/acdf557a-4d40-47a4-81d1-a9c305ca7edb) and purchase a license. Then, open any Panel page that contains the Content Translator view button or section. You will see a license activation notice. Click the **Activate** link to open the activation form:

![Kirby Content Translator activation](/img/kirby-content-translator-activation.png)

Enter the email you used for the purchase and the order number and hit the submit button. Done! Thanks for supporting our work. Once you activate your license, the license activation buttons will disappear.

::note
Your license key will be stored automatically in `/site/config/.kirby-tools-licenses`. This file is created on first activation. Make sure to add it to your `.gitignore` to keep your license key private.
