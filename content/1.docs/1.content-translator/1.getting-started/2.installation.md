## Step 1: Install the Plugin

Although it is a commercial plugin, you can download and test the plugin in your local environment before purchasing it.

### Composer

The recommended way to install the plugin is via Composer. To install the plugin, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
composer require johannschopplich/kirby-content-translator
```

### Download

Head over to the [releases page](https://github.com/kirby-tools/kirby-content-translator/releases) and download the latest version of the plugin as a ZIP file. Extract the contents of this ZIP file to your `site/plugins` folder. It should look like this:

```
site/plugins/
â”œâ”€ kirby-content-translator/
â”‚  â””â”€ â€¦ All plugin files
```

## Step 2: Configure DeepL

By default, this plugin uses the [DeepL API](https://www.deepl.com) to translate your content. However, you can also use any other translation service by defining a [custom translator function](/docs/content-translator/configuration/translator-function).

In order to use the DeepL API, you have to [create an account](https://www.deepl.com/de/pro-api) and [generate an API key](https://www.deepl.com/de/account/summary). The free account is sufficient for most use cases (500,000 characters per month).

Store the API key in your `config.php` file:

```php [config.php]
return [
    'johannschopplich.content-translator' => [
        'DeepL' => [
            // API key for the DeepL free or pro plan
            'apiKey' => '<deepl-api-key>'
        ]
    ]
];
```

## Step 3: Blueprint Setup

### View Button :u-badge{label="v3.0+" class="align-middle ml-2 !rounded-full" variant="subtle"}

Kirby 5 introduces new extensions that allow you to add custom view buttons to most Panel views (e.g. site, page, or file). The Content Translator plugin provides a dropdown button that can be added alongside the default Panel header buttons, such as the languages dropdown button.

To add the `content-translator` dropdown button to a particular view, set the `buttons` option in the corresponding blueprint. The following example shows how to reference the default buttons and add the `content-translator` button to the `site`, `pages`, and `files` views:

::code-group

```yaml [site.yml]
buttons:
  - open
  - preview
  - content-translator # Re-order the button as needed
  - languages
```

```yaml [pages/default.yml]
buttons:
  - open
  - preview
  - settings
  - content-translator # Re-order the button as needed
  - languages
  - status
```

```yaml [files/default.yml]
buttons:
  - open
  - settings
  - content-translator # Re-order the button as needed
  - languages
```

::

This way, you can reference the default buttons and decide where to place the `content-translator` button.

::note
Kirby 4 does not support custom view buttons, but the `content-translator` button has been backported ðŸŽ‰. It is always placed after the language dropdown and cannot be moved. Follow the [configuration guide](/docs/content-translator/configuration/global) for more information or how to disable it.
::

### Section

The Content Translator section gives you fine-grained control over which blueprints should have content translation buttons. This allows you to decide which content is translatable and which is not.

Add the following basic section configuration to a blueprint file:

```yaml [pages/default.yml]
sections:
  contentTranslator:
    type: content-translator
```

This is how the section will look in the default language:

::preview{src="/img/kirby-content-translator-section.png" alt="Content Translator section in default language" width="1026" height="204"}
::

When switching to secondary languages, the section buttons will change to **Import** and **Translate**:

::preview{src="/img/kirby-content-translator-section-secondary-languages.png" alt="Content Translator section in secondary language" width="1026" height="204"}
::

Note that during the testing process, a license notice will be displayed below the translation buttons. You can remove this notice by purchasing a license.

## Step 4: Translate Your Content

Open the Panel and navigate to the page to be translated. Select one of the secondary languages from the Kirby's language drop-down list. The Content Translator Panel view button and section both feature the same buttons: **Import** and **Translate**.

- Click the **Import** button to copy the content from the default language to the currently active language.
- Click the **Translate** button to translate the content of the freshly imported content (which is still in the default language) into the currently selected secondary language.

::callout{icon="i-ri-information-line" color="info" to="/docs/content-translator/configuration/global"}
By default, all text-like fields are translated. You can fully customize the content importing and translation behavior. Follow the configuration guide to learn more.
::

To batch translate content to multiple languages simultaneously, switch to the primary/default language and use the **{Language} â†’ All Languages** button. This allows you to translate content to several target languages at once, which is more efficient than translating to each language individually.

## Step 5: Buy a License

You can test the plugin locally. However, you need to purchase a license to use the plugin in production environments.

Visit the [product page on Lemon Squeezy](https://byjohann.lemonsqueezy.com/buy/acdf557a-4d40-47a4-81d1-a9c305ca7edb) and purchase a license. Then, open any Panel page that contains the Content Translator section. Click the **Activate** link to open the activation form:

![Kirby Content Translator activation](/img/kirby-content-translator-activation.png)

Enter the email you used for the purchase and the order number and hit the submit button. Done! Thanks for supporting our work. Once you activate your license, the license activation buttons will disappear.

::note
Your license key will be automatically stored in the `/site/config/.kirby-tools-licenses` file. Make sure to add this file to your `.gitignore` file to keep your license key private.
