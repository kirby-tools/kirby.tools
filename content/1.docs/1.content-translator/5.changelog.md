## What's New?

### v3.3.1 :u-badge{label="Latest" class="align-middle ml-2 !rounded-full" variant="subtle"}

Released on May 19, 2025.

**🚀 Features**

- Support for the first Kirby 5 release candidate (`Kirby 5.0.0-rc.1`).

### v3.3.0

Released on May 5, 2025.

**🚀 Features**

- Use the language's `LC_ALL` locale (if available) to resolve the DeepL target language.
- Validate language code against DeepL's supported target languages.

::callout{icon="i-ri-information-line"}
For example, if you set `LC_ALL` to `en_UK`, the target language for DeepL will still be `EN`, since `EN-UK` is not supported by DeepL. If you set `LC_ALL` to `en_GB` instead, then the Content Translator will send `EN-GB` as the target language to DeepL.

Released on October 18, 2024.

**🚀 Features**

- New [`translateSlug`](/docs/content-translator/php-api#translateslug) PHP API method.

::

Unlike per-language translation, this translation process **is not reversible** in the Panel and is handled server-side. Use it with caution, as it may take a while to translate all content. When the button is clicked, a confirmation dialog is displayed to prevent accidental batch translation.

::callout{icon="i-ri-information-line"}
If this new feature breaks your workflow, you can disable it by setting `batch: false` in the plugin configuration.
::

When disabled, the section will look the same as in v2.2.0 and earlier versions:

::preview{src="/img/kirby-content-translator-section-batch-disabled.png"}

- Disallow changing the slug on the homepage page ID.
