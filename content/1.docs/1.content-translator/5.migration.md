## Migrating from v2 to v3

Kirby Content Translator v3 is a major overhaul in terms of architecture and features. No breaking changes have been introduced in this version. However, if you are using Kirby 4, you might want to disable the Panel view button, which is now enabled by default.

In Kirby 4, Panel view buttons are not supported. But the feature has been backported. The `content-translator` button is always placed after the language dropdown and cannot be moved. If you want to disable the button, set the `viewButton` option to `false`:

```php [config.php]
return [
    'johannschopplich.content-translator' => [
        'viewButton' => false
    ]
]
```

In Kirby 5, you can enable the Content Translator view buttons per blueprint. The following example shows how to reference the default buttons and add the `content-translator` button to the `site`, `pages`, and `files` views:

::code-group

```yaml [site.yml]
buttons:
  - preview
  - content-translator # Re-order the button as needed
  - languages
```

```yaml [pages/default.yml]
buttons:
  - preview
  - settings
  - content-translator # Re-order the button as needed
  - languages
  - status
```

```yaml [files/default.yml]
buttons:
  - preview
  - settings
  - content-translator # Re-order the button as needed
  - languages
```

## Migrating from v2.x to v2.5

Some users experienced issues with fields where the field content is HTML (e.g. in a `writer` field). With Kirby Content Translator v2.5, every request to the DeepL API is now sent with the `tag_handling` parameter set to `html`. This should fix the issue with HTML content not being translated correctly.

If you experience problems with this new default, you can disable it by setting the `tag_handling` option to `null` in the global configuration:

```php [config.php]
return [
    'johannschopplich.content-translator' => [
        'DeepL' => [
            'requestOptions' => [
                // Disable the `tag_handling` parameter
                'tag_handling' => null
            ]
        ]
    ]
];
```

## Migrating from v1 to v2

The Kirby Content Translator v2 is a major overhaul in terms of architecture and features. This guide will help you migrate your existing projects from the v1 version of the plugin to the v2 version.

### New Configuration Options

While the v1 version relied on parameters like `syncableFields`, `translatableFields`, `translatableStructureFields`, etc., the v2 version introduces a more streamlined approach to managing translatable content. The new version uses a single `fieldTypes` property to define the fields types that should be translated.

By default, the following field types are supported and enabled:

- `blocks`
- `layout`
- `list`
- `object`
- `structure`
- `tags`
- `text`
- `textarea`
- `writer`
- `markdown`

If you want to limit the translation to specific field types, you can use the `fieldTypes` property.

To include or exclude specific fields, you can use the `includeFields` and `excludeFields` properties. Both are empty by default. Note that if at least one entry is defined in `includeFields`, only these fields will be translated. Respectively, if at least one entry is defined in `excludeFields`, all fields except these will be translated.

For example, if you want to translate your whole content, except the `company` field name, you can use the following configuration:

```yaml [sections/content-translator.yml]
type: content-translator
excludeFields:
  - description
  - summary
```

### Removed Properties

The following section properties have been removed in the v2 version in favor of the new `fieldTypes`, `includeFields`, and `excludeFields` properties:

- `syncableFields`
- `translatableFields`
- `translatableStructureFields`
- `translatableObjectFields`
- `translatableBlocks`

### PHP API

Since the PHP API is new in the v2 version, there is no need to migrate any existing PHP code.
