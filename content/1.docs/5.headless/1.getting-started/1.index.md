Kirby Headless is a plugin for [Kirby CMS](https://getkirby.com) that adds headless capabilities to your Kirby site. Use Kirby as a backend to serve content to frontend applications, static site generators, or mobile apps. Add headless functionality to existing sites or build a headless-first CMS from scratch.
