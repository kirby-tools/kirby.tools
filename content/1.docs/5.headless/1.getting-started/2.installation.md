::

::card{title="ZIP File Download" icon="i-ri-folder-zip-line"}
Download the :latest-version{product="headless"} or head over to the [releases page](https://github.com/johannschopplich/kirby-headless/releases) to see all versions. Extract the ZIP file to your `site/plugins` folder.

## Default Behavior

The plugin works out of the box without additional configuration. By default:

- KQL endpoint available at `/api/kql` with bearer token authentication
- Existing routes and templates remain unaffected

::note
Kirby Headless does not interfere with Kirby's default routing unless you enable global routes. Your existing templates and routes continue to work as expected.
::

## Configuration

Customize the plugin behavior with these options:

- [Authentication](/docs/headless/configuration/authentication) – Bearer token or basic auth
- [CORS](/docs/headless/configuration/cors) – Cross-origin request settings
- [Panel](/docs/headless/configuration/panel) – Preview URLs and redirects
