## Install the Plugin

### Composer

The recommended installation method is via Composer:

```bash
composer require johannschopplich/kirby-headless
```

### Download

Download the latest version from the [releases page](https://github.com/johannschopplich/kirby-headless/releases) and extract to your `site/plugins` folder:

```
site/plugins/
├─ kirby-headless/
│  └─ … Plugin files
```

## Default Behavior

The plugin works out of the box without additional configuration. By default:

- KQL endpoint available at `/api/kql` with bearer token authentication
- CORS preflight requests handled automatically
- Existing routes and templates remain unaffected

::note
Kirby Headless does not interfere with Kirby's default routing unless you enable global routes. Your existing templates and routes continue to work as expected.
::

## Configuration

Customize the plugin behavior with these options:

- [Authentication](/docs/headless/configuration/authentication) – Bearer token or basic auth
- [CORS](/docs/headless/configuration/cors) – Cross-origin request settings
- [Panel](/docs/headless/configuration/panel) – Preview URLs and redirects
