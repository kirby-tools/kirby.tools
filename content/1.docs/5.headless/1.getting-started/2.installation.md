## Composer

The recommended way to install the plugin is via Composer. To install the plugin, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
composer require johannschopplich/kirby-headless
```

## Download

Head over to the [releases page](https://github.com/johannschopplich/kirby-headless/releases) and download the latest version of the plugin as a ZIP file. Extract the contents of this ZIP file to your `site/plugins` folder. It should look like this:

```
site/plugins/
├─ kirby-headless/
│  └─ … Plugin files
```

## Setup

Nothing to do here! The plugin is ready to use out of the box. If you want to customize the plugin, you can do so by [configuring it](/docs/headless/configuration).

::note
By default, Kirby Headless does not interfere with Kirby's default routing. Thus, it won't affect your existing routes or templates.
