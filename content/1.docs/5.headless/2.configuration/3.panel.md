## Frontend Preview URLs

In headless setups, Panel preview links point to the backend by default. Use the `frontendUrl` page method to redirect preview links to your frontend application.

### Blueprint Configuration

Set the `preview` option in your blueprint to use the `frontendUrl` method:

```yaml [site/blueprints/pages/default.yml]
options:
  preview: "{{ page.frontendUrl }}"
```

For the site blueprint, use `site.frontendUrl`:

```yaml [site/blueprints/site.yml]
options:
  preview: "{{ site.frontendUrl }}"
```

### Config Setup

Configure your frontend URL in `config.php`:

```php [config.php]
return [
    'headless' => [
        'panel' => [
            'frontendUrl' => 'https://example.com'
        ]
    ]
];
```

::note
If `frontendUrl` is empty, the preview button will be disabled.

## Panel Redirect

For headless-only projects, automatically redirect visitors to the Panel when they access your backend URL. This is useful when your Kirby installation serves no frontend content.

```php [config.php]
return [
    'headless' => [
        'panel' => [
            'redirect' => true
        ]
    ]
];
```

When enabled, unauthenticated requests without a bearer token will redirect to the Panel login page.
