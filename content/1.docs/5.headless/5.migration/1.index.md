## Migrating from v3 to v4

Kirby Headless v4 contains a breaking change: the result of the `toResolvedBlocks()` field method has changed. Before, the resolved blocks fields were nested within the `resolved` key. Now the resolved fields overwrite the original fields. This results in less duplication and a cleaner structure.

Update your frontend code to reflect this change. For example, instead of accessing the `resolved` key like `block.content.resolved.image[0]`, you can now access the resolved field directly like `block.content.image[0]`.

### Resolved Key

If you do not want to update your frontend code, you can still update to v4 and use the old structure by defining a `resolvedKey` in your `config.php`:

```php [config.php]
return [
    'blocksResolver' => [
        'resolvedKey' => 'resolved'
    ]
];
```
