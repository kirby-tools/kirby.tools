## Migrating from v1 to v2

The Kirby Content Translator v2 is a major overhaul in terms of architecture and features. This guide will help you migrate your existing projects from the v1 version of the plugin to the v2 version.

### New Configuration Options

While the v1 version relied on parameters like `syncableFields`, `translatableFields`, `translatableStructureFields`, etc., the v2 version introduces a more streamlined approach to managing translatable content. The new version uses a single `fieldTypes` property to define the fields types that should be translated.

By default, the following field types are supported and enabled:

- `blocks`
- `layout`
- `list`
- `object`
- `structure`
- `tags`
- `text`
- `textarea`
- `writer`

If you want to limit the translation to specific field types, you can use the `fieldTypes` property.

To include or exclude specific fields, you can use the `includeFields` and `excludeFields` properties. Both are empty by default. Note that if at least one entry is defined in `includeFields`, only these fields will be translated. Respectively, if at least one entry is defined in `excludeFields`, all fields except these will be translated.

For example, if you want to translate your whole content, except the `company` field name, you can use the following configuration:

```yaml [sections/content-translator.yml]
type: content-translator
excludeFields:
  - description
  - summary
```

### Removed Properties

The following section properties have been removed in the v2 version in favor of the new `fieldTypes`, `includeFields`, and `excludeFields` properties:

- `syncableFields`
- `translatableFields`
- `translatableStructureFields`
- `translatableObjectFields`
- `translatableBlocks`

### PHP API

Since the PHP API is new in the v2 version, there is no need to migrate any existing PHP code.
