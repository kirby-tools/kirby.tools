[DeepL](https://www.deepl.com) provides industry-leading machine translation with excellent quality for European languages. The free tier includes 500,000 characters per month.

## Setup

To use DeepL as your translation provider, add your API key to the global configuration:

```php [config.php]
return [
    'johannschopplich.content-translator' => [
        'DeepL' => [
            'apiKey' => env('DEEPL_API_KEY')
        ]
    ]
];
```

::tip
The plugin automatically detects whether you're using a free or pro API key and uses the appropriate endpoint.

## Request Options

DeepL offers a variety of options to customize the text translation API endpoint. To learn more about the available options, please refer to the [DeepL translate text parameters](https://developers.deepl.com/docs/api-reference/translate#request-body-descriptions).

To set custom request options for the DeepL API, add them to the plugin's `requestOptions` configuration:

```php [config.php]
return [
    'johannschopplich.content-translator' => [
        'DeepL' => [
            // All available options can be found in the DeepL API documentation:
            // https://developers.deepl.com/docs/api-reference/translate#request-body-descriptions
            'requestOptions' => [
                // Lean towards formal language
                'formality' => 'more'
            ]
        ]
    ]
];
```
