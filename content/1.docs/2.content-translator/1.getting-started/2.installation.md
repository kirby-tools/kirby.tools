## Step 1: Install the Plugin

Although it is a commercial plugin, you can download and test it in your local environment before purchasing.

::card{title="Composer" icon="i-ri-terminal-box-line"}
The recommended way to install the plugin is via Composer. Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
composer require johannschopplich/kirby-content-translator
```

::

::card{title="ZIP File Download" icon="i-ri-folder-zip-line"}
Download the :latest-version or head over to the [releases page](https://github.com/kirby-tools/kirby-content-translator/releases) to see all versions. Extract the ZIP file to your `site/plugins` folder.

::

## Step 2: Configure DeepL

By default, this plugin uses the [DeepL API](https://www.deepl.com) to translate your content. You can also use any other translation service by defining a [custom translator function](/docs/content-translator/configuration/translator-function).

To use the DeepL API, [create an account](https://www.deepl.com/de/pro-api) and [generate an API key](https://www.deepl.com/de/account/summary). The free account is sufficient for most use cases (500,000 characters per month).

Store the API key in your `config.php` file:

```php [config.php]
return [
    'johannschopplich.content-translator' => [
        'DeepL' => [
            // API key for the DeepL free or pro plan
            'apiKey' => '<deepl-api-key>'
        ]
    ]
];
```

## Step 3: Choose Your Workflow

Kirby Content Translator offers two ways to add translation controls to the Panel. Both methods provide the same functionality and can be used together.

::card-group

:::card{title="View Button" icon="i-ri-layout-top-line" to="/docs/content-translator/configuration/local#view-button-configuration"}

Add a translation dropdown to the Panel **toolbar** for quick access from any view.

```yaml [pages/default.yml]
buttons:
  - preview
  - settings
  - content-translator # Choose position
  - languages
  - status
```

:::

:::card{title="Section" icon="i-ri-dashboard-line" to="/docs/content-translator/configuration/local#section-configuration"}

Alternative display with translation controls inline within the page content.

```yaml
contentTranslator:
  type: content-translator
```

:::

::

## Step 4: Translate Your Content

Open the Panel and navigate to a page. The translation workflow depends on your current language:

### In Secondary Languages

1. Click **Import** to copy content from the default language to the current language.
2. Click **Translate** to send the imported content to DeepL for translation.

::tip{icon="i-ri-lightbulb-line"}
**Why two steps?** _Import_ copies the raw content first, then _Translate_ sends it to DeepL. This separation allows you to review content before translation or skip translation for content that does not need it.
::

### In the Default Language

Click **{Language} → All Languages** to translate content to multiple languages at once. A dialog lets you select which target languages to include.

::callout{icon="i-ri-settings-3-line" to="/docs/content-translator/configuration/global"}
By default, all text-like fields are translated. Customize which fields, types, and behaviors apply in the Configuration Guide.
::

## Step 5: Buy a License

You can test the plugin locally. However, you need to purchase a license to use the plugin in production environments.

Visit the [product page on Lemon Squeezy](https://byjohann.lemonsqueezy.com/buy/acdf557a-4d40-47a4-81d1-a9c305ca7edb) and purchase a license. Then, open any Panel page that contains the Content Translator view button or section. You will see a license activation notice. Click the **Activate** link to open the activation form:

![Kirby Content Translator activation](/img/kirby-content-translator-activation.png)

Enter the email you used for the purchase and the order number and hit the submit button. Done! Thanks for supporting our work. Once you activate your license, the license activation buttons will disappear.

::note
Your license key will be stored automatically in `/site/config/.kirby-tools-licenses`. This file is created on first activation. Make sure to add it to your `.gitignore` to keep your license key private.
