The Kirby Content Translator plugin empowers editors to translate content from one language to another with a single click. Add the **Panel view button** to any page, file, or site blueprint and translate content directly in the Kirby Panel using [DeepL](https://www.deepl.com).

## Key Features

- 🖱️ **One-Click Translation**: Translate content directly from the Panel header with the view button.
- 📦 **Batch Translation**: Translate to multiple languages simultaneously from the default language.
- 📄 **All Content Types**: Translate pages, files (metadata), and site content.
- 🧩 **Structure-Aware**: Supports blocks, layouts, structures, objects, and nested fields.
- 🏷️ **KirbyTags Support**: Selectively translate KirbyTag attributes while preserving URLs and UUIDs.
- ⚡ **PHP API**: Automate translations with CLI commands or custom workflows.
- 🪝 **Hooks System**: Customize translation behavior with before/after hooks.
- 🔌 **Custom Providers**: Built-in DeepL support with options for custom translation services.

The plugin integrates seamlessly with the Kirby Panel and provides programmatic access via its [PHP API](/docs/content-translator/advanced/php-api).

## How It Works

Add the `content-translator` Panel view button to your blueprints. The button adapts based on your current language context:

**In secondary languages** two actions appear:

- **Import**: Copy content from the default language to the current language.
- **Translate**: Send content to DeepL for translation.

**In the default language** a batch translation button appears:

- **{Language} → All Languages**: Translate to multiple languages at once

| **Interactivity**     | See & edit immediately   | Background processing      |

## Translation Services

By default, the plugin uses the [DeepL API](https://www.deepl.com) for high-quality translations. DeepL's free tier includes 500,000 characters per month, which is sufficient for most projects. You can also define [custom translation functions](/docs/content-translator/configuration/translator-function) to integrate other providers.
