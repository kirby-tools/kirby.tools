**🚀 Features**

- **Report persistence control**: The new [`persisted`](/docs/seo-audit/configuration/local#persisted) section property controls whether SEO audit reports are saved to local storage. Set to `true` (default) to keep reports between sessions, or `false` to always start with a fresh analysis. This is useful when you want editors to run a new audit each time they open a page.
