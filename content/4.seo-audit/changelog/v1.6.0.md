**🚀 Features**

- **Content scope selection**: The new [`contentSelector`](/docs/seo-audit/configuration/local#contentselector) property lets you define a CSS selector for the main content area to analyze. This excludes headers, footers, sidebars, and navigation from SEO analysis, providing more accurate assessments focused on your actual page content.

```yaml [sections/seo-audit.yml]
type: seo-audit
contentSelector: "#main-content"
```
