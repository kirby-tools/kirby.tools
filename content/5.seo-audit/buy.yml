  items:
    - label: How does the licensing work?
      content: The license allows you to use the plugin on as many Kirby projects as you want, as long as you are the owner of all the sites. This means that you must own the code, which is usually the case when you develop websites for clients. Please refer to the [license agreement](/license) for more details.
    - label: What if the SEO report is incorrect?
      content: We don't guarantee that the SEO checks are 100% accurate. Some assessments are based on the [`yoastseo`](/docs/seo-audit/guide/assessments) JavaScript package. We are not responsible for any incorrect audits provided by it. However, we are constantly adding new assessments, built by us, to improve the accuracy of the SEO checks. Please test the plugin in the [playground](/seo-audit/playground) before purchasing.
    - label: Which Kirby versions are supported?
      content: Kirby SEO Audit is compatible with Kirby 4 and Kirby 5.
    - label: What does “Unlimited minor & patch updates” include?
      content: We add new features and improvements to Kirby SEO Audit as we get ideas and feedback. You will receive these updates for the major version you have purchased. When a new major version is released, you will be able to upgrade to that version at a generous discount. A typical major version is intended to be released alongside a new major Kirby version.
    - label: How do I receive updates for the plugin?
      content: If you have installed the plugin via Composer, run `composer update`. Otherwise, download the latest version of the plugin as a ZIP file from the [releases page](https://github.com/kirby-tools/kirby-seo-audit/releases) on GitHub.
    - label: Do you offer technical support?
      content: You can ask questions, report bugs or feature requests on our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/johannschopplich/kirby-seo-audit). If you need personal support or advice, please [contact us](/contact).
    - label: What is your refund policy?
      content: We offer a 30-day money back guarantee for the plugin. If you are not satisfied with your purchase, you can [request a full refund](/contact) within 30 days of purchase. (Although we would appreciate feedback on how we can improve the plugin.)
