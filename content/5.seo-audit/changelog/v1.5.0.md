**ðŸš€ Features**

- As an alternative to both the `keyphraseField` and `synonymsField` properties (which are separate fields that an editor has to fill in) you can define keywords/keyphrases and synonyms directly in the blueprint:
  - [`keyphrase`](/docs/seo-audit/get-started/configuration#keyphrase)
  - [`synonyms`](/docs/seo-audit/get-started/configuration#synonyms)

Both of these new properties support **Kirby queries**. For example, you can use the page title as a keyword next to a list of synonyms:

```yaml [sections/seo-audit.yml]
type: seo-audit
keyphrase: "{{ page.title.value }}"
synonyms:
  - Kirby
  - SEO
  - Audit
```
