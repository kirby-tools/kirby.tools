**🚀 Features**

- **Language compatibility validation**: The plugin now validates that configured assessments are compatible with the current Panel language. Some Yoast assessments (like transition words) only work with specific languages. If you configure an incompatible assessment, the plugin will [show a clear error](/docs/seo-audit/guide/assessments) instead of failing silently, helping you choose appropriate assessments for your content language.
