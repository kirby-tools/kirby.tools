**🐞 Bug Fixes**

- **Image alt assessment accuracy**: The `alt` attribute assessment is now skipped when the analyzed content contains no images. Previously, pages without images would show a misleading "Good" result for alt attributes, implying images were checked when none existed. Now the assessment is only shown when relevant.
