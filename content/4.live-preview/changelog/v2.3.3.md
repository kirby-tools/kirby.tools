**🐞 Bug Fixes**

- **Template validation**: The plugin now throws a descriptive exception if the `<head>` tag is missing in your page template. Live Preview requires a `<head>` tag to inject the necessary JavaScript for real-time updates. Previously, templates without a `<head>` tag would fail silently. The error message now clearly indicates which template needs to be fixed.
