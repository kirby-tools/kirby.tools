**Initial Release**

Kirby Live Preview v1.0 brings real-time content preview directly into the Kirby Panel. See your changes rendered instantly as you edit, without switching between the Panel and your website.

**🚀 Features**

- **Real-time preview**: Content updates are rendered in the preview iframe as you type, providing instant visual feedback.
- **Panel section**: Add the preview section to any blueprint with `type: preview`. Works with pages and site blueprints.
- **Sticky layout support**: Make the preview sticky in your blueprint layout for side-by-side editing alongside blocks and other fields.
- **Panel link navigation**: Click links in the preview to navigate to the corresponding Panel page instead of the frontend URL.
- **Configurable refresh**: Control the preview update behavior with the [`updateInterval`](/docs/live-preview/configuration#updateinterval) option.

For setup instructions, see the [Getting Started](/docs/live-preview) guide.
