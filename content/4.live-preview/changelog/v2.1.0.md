**🚀 Features**

- **Preview alternate pages**: The new [`pageId`](/docs/live-preview/configuration#pageid) section property lets you preview a different page than the one being edited. This is useful for previewing how site-level changes affect a specific page, or for previewing template pages from a settings panel.
- **Improved sticky scroll behavior**: Section height calculation for sticky previews has been improved, providing smoother scrolling behavior when editing content alongside the preview.
