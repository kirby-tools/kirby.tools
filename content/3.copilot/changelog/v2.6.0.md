**🚀 Features**

- **Block type exclusions**: The new [`excludedBlocks`](/docs/copilot/configuration/global#excludedblocks) global option lets you prevent specific block types from being generated by Copilot. This is useful when you have custom blocks that require manual content (e.g., embed blocks, form blocks) or blocks that should only be added by editors intentionally.

```php [config.php]
return [
    'johannschopplich.copilot' => [
        'excludedBlocks' => ['embed', 'form', 'code']
    ]
];
```
