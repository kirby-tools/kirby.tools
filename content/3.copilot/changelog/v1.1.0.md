**Official Release**

This version marks the official public release of Kirby Copilot. The plugin is now available for purchase and production use.

**🚀 Features**

- **Mistral AI support**: Use [Mistral AI](https://docs.mistral.ai/getting-started/models) models as an alternative to OpenAI. Configure the `mistral` provider in your [global configuration](/docs/copilot/configuration/global) with your API key.
- **Image context**: Add images as context for AI prompts to generate content based on visual input. Configure image files using the [`files`](/docs/copilot/usage/section#files) section property.

**🐞 Bug Fixes**

- **Image format restrictions**: Limited image context file types to PNG, JPEG, WEBP, and non-animated GIF. These are the formats supported by vision-capable AI models. Animated GIFs and other image formats are not supported for context.
