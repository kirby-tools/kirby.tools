**🚀 Features**

- **PDF context support**: Add PDF files as context for AI prompts. Text content is extracted from each PDF and appended to the prompt, enabling AI generation based on document content. Configure PDF files using the [`files`](/docs/copilot/configuration/local#files) section property.

**🐞 Bug Fixes**

- **Hosting compatibility**: Changed plugin asset extension from `.mjs` to `.js` for better compatibility with hosting providers that don't serve `.mjs` files with the correct MIME type.
