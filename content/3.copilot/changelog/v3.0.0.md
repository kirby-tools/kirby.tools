Kirby Copilot v3 is a **free upgrade** for all Gen 2 license holders. If you purchased before December 2024, you can upgrade at 50% off via [hub.kirby.tools](https://hub.kirby.tools).

This release brings significant security improvements and powerful new features.

**🔒 Security**

- **Server-side API proxy**: All AI provider requests now route through a server-side proxy. Your API keys are no longer exposed in browser network requests, protecting them from Panel users.

**🚀 Features**

- **Tab-triggered auto-completion** in writer fields with dedicated [`completionModel`](/docs/copilot/configuration/global#default-models) configuration per provider. Press `Tab` to accept AI suggestions, `Escape` to dismiss. Ghost text preview shows suggestions inline. Manually trigger with `Cmd + ,` / `Ctrl + ,`. See the [Auto-Completion documentation](/docs/copilot/usage/auto-completion).
- **Global `reasoningEffort`** configuration for all reasoning-capable models (GPT-5, Gemini 3, Claude 4). Controls the depth of reasoning during generation. See the [Global Configuration documentation](/docs/copilot/configuration/global#reasoningeffort).
- **Writer mark formatting preservation**: Replacing selected text now preserves all formatting (bold, italic, links, etc.). Generation supports all Kirby writer built-in marks.
- **Prompt templates**: Save frequently used prompts as templates. Five built-in templates included (Fix Grammar, Make Concise, Simplify, Extend, Summarize). See the [Prompt Dialog documentation](/docs/copilot/usage/prompt-dialog).
- **Enhanced prompt history**: Access recent prompts via dropdown menu with arrow key navigation.

**🚨 Breaking Changes**

- The `temperature` option has been removed. Modern reasoning models (GPT-5, Gemini 3, Claude 4) manage creativity internally. Use [`reasoningEffort`](/docs/copilot/configuration/global#reasoningeffort) instead.
