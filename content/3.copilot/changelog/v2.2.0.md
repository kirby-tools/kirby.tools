**🚀 Features**

- Enable image input for prompts when using an **Anthropic** model.
- **Per-site prompt history**: Prompt history is now stored separately for each Kirby installation, identified by hostname. Previously, all sites shared the same history in local storage. Now, working with multiple Kirby projects keeps each site's prompt history isolated, making it easier to reuse site-specific prompts.
- Pass all API errors to the Panel user interface for better error handling. This helps to catch issues, such as the following with the `o3-mini` model:
  > Invalid content type. image_url is only supported by certain models.
