**🐞 Bug Fixes**

- **Temperature default handling**: The plugin no longer sets a default `temperature` value, allowing AI providers to use their own optimal defaults. Previously, a hardcoded temperature could conflict with certain models (like reasoning models) that work best with provider defaults. If you want explicit control, you can still set `temperature` in your [provider configuration](/docs/copilot/configuration/global#temperature).
