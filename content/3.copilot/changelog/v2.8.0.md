**🚀 Features**

- Custom user prompts for `writer` and `textarea` fields. Define a [`userPrompt`](/docs/copilot/usage/toolbar-buttons#predefined-user-prompts) in your field configuration to pre-fill the Copilot dialog with context-specific instructions. Works with nested fields in blocks and layouts.

```yaml
fields:
  text:
    type: writer
    marks:
      - copilot
    copilot:
      userPrompt: Check grammar and improve writing style. Keep the original meaning and tone.
```
